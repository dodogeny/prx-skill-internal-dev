# Prx Internal Dev Skill — Claude Code Plugin `v1.2.1`

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin that gives Claude a structured, end-to-end developer workflow for V1 Jira tickets. The skill has two modes:

- **Dev Mode** — you hand Claude a ticket key and it walks through the full cycle from ticket ingestion to proposed fix and archived PDF report (12 steps).
- **PR Review Mode** — you hand Claude a ticket key with the word `review` and the team reviews the code changes on the associated feature branch, producing a structured findings report as a PDF (8 steps).

Instead of manually reading a ticket, searching for files, and figuring out where to start (or manually reviewing a diff against acceptance criteria), you invoke one command and Claude handles it end to end.

---

## What It Does

The skill runs in one of two modes based on how you invoke it.

### Dev Mode

When you hand Claude a Jira ticket key (`IV-XXXX`), the skill executes **14 steps automatically** (Step 0 → Steps 1–12 → Step 13), presenting output at each step as it completes.

---

### Step 1 — Ingest Ticket

Fetches the Jira issue requesting only the 13 fields that matter — summary, type, priority, status, assignee, reporter, labels, components, fix version, affected versions, description, comments, and attachments. Sprint metadata, change logs, epic links, and watcher lists are not fetched.

If the MCP call fails (authentication error, ticket not found, MCP not running), Claude states the exact error and stops — it does not proceed with partial or missing data. The developer is given clear recovery steps before continuing.

---

### Step 2 — Analyse & Contextualise

Claude analyses the ticket description, all linked tickets, and all attachments, and produces:

- **Problem statement** — A concise description of what is broken or missing, who is affected, what the expected behaviour is, what the current behaviour is, and a clear list of acceptance criteria. Bugs are explicitly labelled as defects; enhancements are explicitly labelled as stories.
- **Linked & associated tickets** — All issue links are fetched (blocked by, blocks, relates to, cloned from, duplicates, is caused by, parent/child epics, sub-tasks). For each linked ticket, Claude retrieves the full ticket details and extracts any context that enriches the current analysis: prior investigation findings, acceptance criteria changes, root cause or fix details from related bugs, design decisions from parent epics, and known workarounds from related tickets. The same attachment analysis rules apply to qualifying attachments on linked tickets. All relevant findings are carried forward into Step 3's Prior Investigation Summary.
- **Attachment review & diagnostic artefact analysis** — All qualifying attachments up to 10 MB are downloaded and analysed (from both the primary ticket and any linked tickets). Binary files, archives, and files over 10 MB are skipped automatically. Each attachment is identified by filename, type, and a one-line finding before detailed analysis:
  - *Screenshots / images* — UI state, error banners, field values, and any visible error codes are described
  - *Log files* — scanned for stack traces, exception chains, and error patterns; root cause frame extracted
  - *Thread dumps* — blocked/waiting threads identified, deadlock chains traced, contention point noted with class/method/line
  - *Memory / heap dumps* — dominant object type identified, exhausted heap space noted, GC patterns extracted
  - *XML / config files* — relevant config values checked for incorrect or missing entries
  - *draw.io diagrams* — flow depicted is described
  All attachment findings are carried forward into the root cause analysis in Step 7.
- **Issue diagram** (optional) — For issues involving a non-obvious data flow or multi-step component interaction, Claude generates a draw.io XML diagram (`.drawio` file) showing the happy path alongside the broken path, annotated with the key method calls and data values involved. Trivial single-file bugs skip this automatically.

---

### Step 3 — Read Comments & Context

Claude fetches all comments on the ticket and extracts:

- **Clarifications** from the reporter or PO that affect scope or behaviour
- **Decisions** made in comments that change the implementation approach
- **Known constraints, edge cases, or related tickets** referenced by the team
- **Prior investigation summary** — if any comments contain previous investigation work (root cause findings, code traces, attempted fixes, identified files, or partial solutions), Claude extracts these as a structured block and carries them forward as known context for Steps 5, 7, and 8. This prevents re-investigating what is already established.

If there are no comments, Claude states this and proceeds from the description only.

---

### Step 4 — Create Development Branch

Claude determines the correct base branch using a three-tier priority:

1. **Fix Version is set** → derives the version string (e.g. `1.24.292` from `1.24.292.p1`), then checks whether `Feature/Release_{VERSION}` exists locally or on the remote. If found, forks from it so the fix builds on top of any release-level work already in progress. If not found, falls back to the plain version branch.
2. **Affected Versions is set** → forks from the plain version branch (e.g. `1.24.292`), stripping any patch suffix.
3. **Neither set** → forks from `development`.

**Confirmation gate:** Before any `git checkout`, Claude verifies the base branch exists locally or on the remote. If it cannot be confirmed in either place, Claude stops and asks the developer which branch to use rather than silently forking from a stale HEAD.

The feature branch is named: `Feature/IV-XXXX_Ticket_Summary_In_Title_Case` and checked out ready to code.

---

### Step 5 — Locate Affected Code

Claude searches the V1 codebase using a **grep-first, read-second** approach — it never reads an entire file speculatively. The flow is:

1. `Grep` to find the relevant class, method name, or keyword → get the exact file path and line number
2. `Read` only the relevant line range (the method ± surrounding context)
3. Full file reads only if the method spans many lines or the grep result is ambiguous

This is the primary token-saving measure — reading a 40-line method costs ~60 tokens vs ~3,000 tokens to read a 2,000-line Java file in full.

Claude builds a **file map** — a table of every affected file, its role in the fix, and the specific method or line range identified. The map also notes recent git history on primary files to surface related recent changes.

For **enhancement tickets that add new fields or methods**, Claude performs a mandatory **class hierarchy check**: it greps for the target class's inheritance chain, identifies the abstract base class (if any), and finds all sibling subclasses. This determines whether the new infrastructure (fields, getters/setters, utility methods) belongs in the concrete class or in the abstract base — where it would be inherited automatically by all current and future subclasses. Only config wiring (`getConfig()` items, `setAttribute()` cases) stays in the concrete class.

A **confidence gate** runs after the file map: if Claude cannot locate the relevant code with reasonable certainty, it pauses and asks for guidance rather than generating a speculative fix on the wrong files.

---

### Step 6 — Replicate the Issue

Claude produces complete, numbered reproduction instructions that any developer on the team can follow without prior knowledge of the issue:

- **Prerequisites** — which V1 modules must be running, which user role is needed, what test data must exist, any environment-specific notes (Oracle vs PostgreSQL, specific config flags)
- **Reproduction steps** — numbered step-by-step actions from login through to the symptom
- **Expected result** — what the system should do when working correctly
- **Actual result** — the exact symptom the reporter observes
- **Service restart guidance** — which spawner, worker, or application server must be restarted to pick up the fix during local testing, listed per layer (Plugin/Worker, Backend API, GWT Frontend)

A **confidence gate** applies: High confidence proceeds automatically; Medium notes the assumption and proceeds; Low pauses and asks the developer to clarify before continuing to Step 7.

---

### Step 7 — Root Cause Analysis

Step 7 has two paths. The correct path is chosen based on the Diagnostic Decision Tree (7a):

| Ticket type | Path |
|-------------|------|
| **Bug** (Data / UI / Async / Regression) | Engineering Panel (7b–7i) |
| **Enhancement** (feature that never existed) | Direct Analysis (Step 7-ENH) |

#### 7a. Diagnostic Decision Tree

The failure mode is classified first:
- **BUG — Data Issue** → NPE, field mapping error, SQL/ORM misconfiguration
- **BUG — UI Issue** → GWT callback not wired, RPC error swallowed, missing panel reload
- **BUG — Async/Timing Issue** → race condition, deadlock, out-of-order execution
- **BUG — Regression** → was working, now broken — Alex leads
- **Enhancement** → pure addition or modification of existing flow → **skip the Engineering Panel; go to Step 7-ENH**

---

#### Step 7-ENH — Enhancement Direct Analysis *(Enhancement tickets only)*

For enhancements, Claude skips the Engineering Panel entirely and performs a direct analysis:

1. **What needs to be added** — explains what the feature is and why it does not currently exist; states `"The system currently lacks X. We need to add Y at Z."` with specific file:line references
2. **Insertion point analysis** — identifies every file, method, and layer that must be touched, with a reason for each; runs the class hierarchy check (same as Step 5) to confirm whether new fields/methods belong in the abstract base or the concrete class
3. **Git history check** — confirms no partial implementation exists in any branch; if a partial exists, builds on it rather than duplicating
4. **Enhancement Statement** — a structured summary block (replaces the Root Cause Statement for Step 8):

```
ENHANCEMENT STATEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What is missing : [one sentence — what the system cannot currently do]
Insertion points: [file:line for each touch point]
Approach        : [one paragraph — the design decision]
Class hierarchy : [N/A / Confirmed concrete class is correct /
                   Moved to {AbstractBase} — {N} sibling classes benefit]
Partial exists  : [No — confirmed by git log / Yes — {branch:file:line}]
Confidence      : High / Medium / Low
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If confidence is Low, Claude stops and asks for developer clarification before proceeding to Step 8.

After completing Step 7-ENH, Claude proceeds directly to Step 8 (Propose the Fix).

---

#### Engineering Panel *(Bug tickets only — 7b through 7i)*

For bug tickets, a four-person senior engineering team convenes: **Morgan** (Lead Developer) chairs and has final authority; **Alex**, **Sam**, and **Jordan** (Senior Engineers) investigate independently under a time constraint and compete for the best analysis. The team debates, challenges each other's findings, and converges on a single agreed root cause.

**The team:**

| Role | Name | Background | Mandate |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Lead Developer** | **Morgan** | 20 yrs Java, ex-systems architect, deep GWT/Spring/Oracle | Chairs. Sets schedule. Reviews hypotheses. Asks probing questions. Facilitates debate. Gives binding verdict. Approves the Root Cause Statement. Riley's concerns are factored into Morgan's verdict and Fix Review. |
| Senior Engineer | Alex | 12 yrs Java/GWT | Code archaeology & regression forensics — *"Every bug has a birthday."* |
| Senior Engineer | Sam | 10 yrs full-stack Java, Spring, GWT RPC | Runtime data flow & logic — *"Follow the data to the divergence point."* |
| Senior Engineer | Jordan | 15 yrs Java, architect background | Defensive patterns & structural anti-patterns — *"I've catalogued every way Java devs shoot themselves in the foot."* Jordan runs a prioritised 20-pattern checklist covering null safety, async errors, silent exceptions, thread safety, resource leaks, mutable static state, layer violations, serialization mismatches, broken equals/hashCode contracts, breaking API changes, circular dependencies, hardcoded environment values, and class hierarchy ownership. |
| **Senior Lead Tester** | **Riley** | 18 yrs QA & test architecture, Java enterprise, GWT, regression suites | Maps test surface and regression risk. Questions engineer findings on impact and testability grounds. Not competing — challenging. Riley's open question must be answered before a fix is approved; any High regression risk must be addressed or explicitly accepted by Morgan. |

Morgan and Riley are not competing — Morgan arbitrates, Riley challenges. Morgan's verdict is binding and must include a response to Riley's assessment.

**How the session runs:**

| Phase | Who | Time | What happens |
|-------|-----|------|-------------|
| **Briefing** | Morgan | 1 min | Reads ticket + file map, assigns focus areas to engineers and Riley, sets schedule |
| **Investigation** | Alex, Sam, Jordan + Riley | 4 min | Engineers investigate independently (max 8 ops each); Riley maps impact surface (max 6 ops) |
| **Mid-point check-in** | All | T+2 min | All four report progress to Morgan; Morgan acknowledges or redirects |
| **Hypothesis + assessment submission** | All | T+4 min | Engineers submit structured hypotheses; Riley submits Testing Impact Assessment |
| **Riley's questions + cross-examination** | Riley + Morgan | T+5 min | Riley poses open question to named engineer; Morgan cross-examines all hypotheses |
| **Debate** | All | T+5–6 min | One round of challenges — engineers on code grounds, Riley on impact/testability grounds |
| **Morgan's verdict** | Morgan | T+6 min | Scores hypotheses (max 15 pts), addresses Riley's assessment, declares adopted root cause |

Each engineer has a maximum of **8 targeted grep/read operations**; Riley has **6**. Morgan may run up to **4 additional targeted reads** to verify contested claims.

Morgan applies a 9-criterion scoring rubric (max 15 pts — the 9th criterion awards +1 if the fix direction is testable and Riley raised no High regression risk against it). The highest scorer wins. Morgan must include a **Tester's view** block in the verdict addressing Riley's regression risk and open question. The final Root Cause Statement includes a **Tester note** field capturing any outstanding Riley concern the fix author must handle.

#### Morgan Reviews the Proposed Fix (Step 8 gate)

After the fix is proposed in Step 8, Morgan vets it across **seven checks**: mechanism alignment, surgical scope, regression risk, team note honoured, DB safety, abstract class ownership, and **tester concerns addressed** (Riley's High/Medium impact concerns from Step 7e must be resolved or explicitly accepted as risk). Verdict is one of:

- **✅ APPROVED** — fix is correct, surgical, and safe to apply
- **⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** — apply after addressing a specific requirement
- **🔄 REWORK REQUIRED** — fix does not address the mechanism; Morgan provides direction for revision

The fix is not applied until Morgan approves.

---

### Step 8 — Propose the Fix

Claude reads the identified files and produces a fix grounded in the analysis from Step 7:
- **Bug tickets** — anchored to the Root Cause Statement from Step 7i (winning engineer, approved by Morgan)
- **Enhancement tickets** — anchored to the Enhancement Statement from Step 7-ENH

- **Proposed solution** — plain-language description of the approach before any code is shown
- **Code changes** — only the code that needs to change, shown as clear before/after blocks. Each change is explicitly tied to the root cause mechanism.
- **Alternative approaches** — a brief table of alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- **Apply to branch (interactive)** — after presenting the fix, Claude asks whether to apply the changes directly to the feature branch. Options: `yes` (apply all), `no` (developer applies manually), `partial` (apply selected files only). Changes are applied using targeted edits — no commit is made.
- **DB migration scripts** — if the fix requires schema changes, both an Oracle (`.sql`) and a PostgreSQL (`.pg`) script are provided. V1 supports both engines and SQL syntax is not assumed to be compatible across them.

---

### Step 9 — Impact Analysis

A full review of the consequences of the fix across the entire application — backed by active codebase searching, not assumptions:

- **Files changed table** — every file touched, the action taken (modified/created/deleted), what changed, and why
- **Usage reference search** — for every modified method, class, field, or API, Claude greps the full codebase and produces a reference table of all callers and usages found. Public methods, interface implementations, DB columns, and GWT RPC service methods are all checked. A symbol confirmed unused outside its class is explicitly stated as such.
- **Application-wide impact** — a layer-by-layer impact table covering: GWT Frontend, Backend API, Plugin/Workers, DB/Schema, and Shared Utilities. Each layer states the impact level and detail. Layers with zero references found are confirmed as unaffected.
- **Regression risks** — for each change: which existing flows are affected, callers that may behave differently after the change, DB data impact, and any race conditions or null pointer risks introduced
- **Affected clients/environments** — whether the fix is generic (all clients), client-specific (named client due to config differences), or DB-specific (different behaviour on Oracle vs PostgreSQL)
- **Retest checklist** — screens and flows outside the primary fix that should be smoke-tested, derived from the actual callers found in the usage search
- **Risk level** — rated objectively based on caller count: Low (0–1 callers), Medium (2–5), High (6+ or DB/shared utility change) — stated prominently with a justification sentence

---

### Step 10 — Change Summary

Claude compiles a developer-ready summary covering:

- **Files touched** — table of every file modified, created, or deleted with a one-line description
- **What changed and why** — one paragraph per file explaining the change and the reasoning
- **Suggested commit message** — ready-to-paste, following the project convention: `IV-XXXX_Title_VERSION`
- **PR description template** — a fully populated pull request body including Jira link, branch, **root cause statement** from Step 6, risk level, what changed, how to test, retest areas, and DB migration flag — ready to paste directly into GitHub/Bitbucket

---

### Step 11 — Session Stats

Prints a single summary line with elapsed time, estimated token usage, and estimated cost at Sonnet 4.6 pricing:

```
IV-3672 | ~14m elapsed | ~5,100 in / ~2,040 out tokens | est. cost $0.0462 (Sonnet 4.6)
```

---

### Step 12 — PDF Analysis Report

Claude generates a full-detail PDF report of the complete analysis — every section from every step — and saves it to a configurable output folder.

#### Report contents

The PDF is structured in 11 sections, one per step. Every section is fully populated from the actual analysis output — nothing is summarised or omitted:

| Section | Contents captured |
|---------|------------------|
| **Step 1 — Jira Ticket** | Full field table (key, type, priority, status, assignee, reporter, labels, components, fix/affected versions) + complete ticket description verbatim + attachment list |
| **Step 2 — Problem Understanding** | Problem statement table (what/who/expected/actual/acceptance criteria), ticket classification, linked & associated tickets summary (one line per linked ticket with type/status/relevance), attachment analysis findings, draw.io diagram note |
| **Step 3 — Comments & Context** | Comment summary bullets, full Prior Investigation Summary block (if found) |
| **Step 4 — Development Branch** | Base branch selected + reason, feature branch name, creation status |
| **Step 5 — Locate Affected Code** | Full file map table (file, role, key location, recent git history), confidence level, full class hierarchy analysis (if performed) |
| **Step 6 — Replication Guide** | Prerequisites, environment, numbered replication steps, expected vs actual table, confidence level, service restart guidance |
| **Step 7 — Root Cause Analysis** | **Bug tickets:** full Engineering Panel session — Morgan's briefing, mid-point check-in (Alex/Sam/Jordan/Riley), all four hypothesis/assessment blocks, Riley's question + engineer response, Morgan's cross-examination + engineer responses, full debate round, Morgan's scored verdict (with Tester's view), Root Cause Statement (with Tester note). **Enhancement tickets:** full Enhancement Statement (7-ENH) |
| **Step 8 — Proposed Fix** | Quoted analysis anchor, full proposed solution narrative + all before/after code blocks with annotations, alternatives table, full Morgan Fix Review block (all 7 checks + verdict), DB migration scripts (if applicable) |
| **Step 9 — Impact Analysis** | Files changed table, usage reference search results table (all symbols), application-wide impact table, regression risks list, affected clients/environments, retest areas, risk level with justification |
| **Step 10 — Change Summary** | Change summary bullets, suggested commit message, full PR description template |
| **Step 11 — Session Statistics** | Steps completed, elapsed time, estimated tokens, estimated cost, ticket type, RCA path taken, fix applied flag |

#### Generation

- **Output folder** — reads `$CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` environment variable if set; defaults to `$HOME/Documents/DevelopmentTasks/Claude-Analyzed-Tickets/`
- **PDF generation** — tries three methods in order, stopping at the first that succeeds:
  1. **`pandoc`** — best quality, handles tables and code blocks correctly; install via `brew install pandoc` (macOS), `apt install pandoc` (Linux), or the [pandoc installer](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) (Windows)
  2. **Chrome / Chromium headless** — uses `--print-to-pdf`; works on all platforms if Chrome is installed; no additional setup required
  3. **HTML fallback** — saves a styled `.html` file and instructs the developer to print to PDF from their browser
- **Confirmation** — always displays both the output folder and the full file path after saving
- **Cleanup** — intermediate temp files (`/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md`, `.html`) are removed after the report is saved

---

### Knowledge Base (Step 0 + Step 13 / Step R0 + Step R9)

Every Dev and Review session feeds into a **shared, persistent knowledge base** stored as plain Markdown files. The KB grows richer after every ticket — capturing business rules, root causes, recurring patterns, architecture insights, and regression risks so the whole team becomes progressively smarter about the codebase.

#### Two storage modes

Choose how the KB is stored by setting the `PRX_KB_MODE` environment variable:

| Mode | KB location | Distribution | Access control | Encryption |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **local** *(default)* | `$HOME/Documents/Prx/KnowledgeBase/` | None — private to one machine | Local filesystem | None — plain Markdown |
| **distributed** | Local clone of your private KB repo | Via git push/pull to your team's own private repository | Your git server's permissions (Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab…) | Optional AES-256-CBC (`.md.enc`) |

**Local mode** is the default and requires no extra configuration. The KB lives on your machine only.

**Distributed mode** shares the KB across your whole team via a **dedicated private git repository you own and control** (`PRX_KB_REPO`). You decide who can access it — restrict it to your company's Bitbucket or GitHub Enterprise org and the knowledge never leaves your environment. No data goes to any public repository.

> **Why a separate private repo?** Keeping the KB in its own dedicated repository makes access control straightforward: grant or revoke access to the KB repo independently of any product codebase. A company-owned private Bitbucket or internal GitLab is ideal — only employees with access to that repo can read or push knowledge base content.

#### KB repository structure

The KB is a standalone git repository with a flat, predictable layout. Whether stored locally or distributed, the directory structure is always the same:

```
prx-kb/                         ← root of the KB git repository
├── README.md                       ← auto-created on first push (repo description)
│
├── INDEX.md                        ← Combined KB index (two sections):
│                                      ## Memory Palace — primary retrieval layer.
│                                        Maps V1 system areas to named Rooms.
│                                        Each knowledge entry has a vivid trigger phrase
│                                        so agents recognise relevance in under 1 second.
│                                      ## Master Index — fallback retrieval layer.
│                                        One row per knowledge entry (tickets + shared).
│                                        Greppable by ticket key, component, label, trigger.
│
├── tickets/                        ← One file per analysed or reviewed ticket
│   ├── IV-3672.md                  ← Bug fix: alerts not resolved on case close
│   ├── IV-3695.md                  ← Enhancement: bulk-resolve endpoint
│   └── IV-3801.md                  ← Review: IV-3672 fix verified
│
└── shared/                         ← Accumulated team knowledge (growing over time)
    ├── business-rules.md           ← Domain invariants that must always hold
    │                                  (e.g. "resolving a case must resolve its alerts")
    ├── architecture.md             ← Class hierarchies, data flows, ownership decisions
    │                                  (e.g. "AbstractXxxListener owns shared config")
    ├── patterns.md                 ← Recurring bug/fix patterns with frequency counters
    │                                  (e.g. "Boolean flag set, never reset — seen 3×")
    └── regression-risks.md         ← Fragile areas that require care on every change
                                       (e.g. "resolveCase() called from 4 screens")
```

**In distributed mode with encryption enabled**, all `.md` files are replaced by `.md.enc` binary blobs on disk and in the remote repo. The structure is identical — only the file extension changes.

#### What each file contains

| File | Written by | Contents |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `INDEX.md` | Steps 13d–13e / R9d–R9e | Two sections: `## Memory Palace` — per-room trigger tables (trigger phrase → KB entry ID → type → file); `## Master Index` — flat table of all entries (ticket/ID, date, type, components, labels, summary, trigger, file). |
| `tickets/IV-XXXX.md` | Steps 13b / R9b | Full session record: problem, root cause, fix, business rules discovered, architecture insights, patterns observed, regression risks, related tickets, verdict (review sessions). |
| `shared/business-rules.md` | Steps 13c / R9c | Domain invariants. Each entry confirmed or violated across sessions. |
| `shared/architecture.md` | Steps 13c / R9c | Class hierarchy decisions, data flow knowledge, ownership rules. |
| `shared/patterns.md` | Steps 13c / R9c | Recurring patterns with `Frequency: N` counter — incremented each recurrence. |
| `shared/regression-risks.md` | Steps 13c / R9c | Fragile areas flagged by Riley or discovered via usage searches. |

#### Storage layout (on developer's machine)

```
$HOME/.prx/kb/                  ← KNOWLEDGE_DIR (local clone of the private KB repo)
│                                     Contains the files above.
│                                     In encrypted mode: .md.enc files at rest.
│
/tmp/prx-kb-{PID}/              ← KB_WORK_DIR (encrypted mode only)
│                                     Decrypted .md files for the current session.
│                                     Deleted automatically after push.
```

In local mode and in unencrypted distributed mode, all files are plain `.md` and `KB_WORK_DIR` points directly to `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` — no temp directory is used.

#### Encryption (distributed mode — optional, defense-in-depth)

Encryption is not required when the KB is already in a private repository with proper access controls. Enable it for defense-in-depth — for example, if there is any risk the repo could be accidentally made public, or if company policy requires data encrypted at rest.

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-CBC |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2-SHA512, 310,000 iterations, random salt per file |
| Key source | `PRX_KB_KEY` env var — **never committed to git** |
| Files on disk (encrypted) | Binary `.md.enc` blobs — appear as garbage without the key |
| Files in session (encrypted) | Decrypted to `/tmp/prx-kb-{PID}/` only; deleted after push |
| Files on disk (unencrypted) | Plain `.md` — accessed directly from the local clone |

#### Team distribution (distributed mode)

| Action | When | What happens |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Pull** (get latest from team) | Start of every session (Step 0a) | `git pull origin main`; clone first if local clone doesn't exist. If encrypted: decrypt to session temp dir. Then **re-index** (see below). |
| **Push** (share with team) | End of every session (Steps 13f / R9f) | Remote existence check → commit → push. Auto-creates `origin/main` on first push via `--set-upstream`. If encrypted: encrypt before push, delete temp dir after. |

> **First-time setup:** The skill clones the private KB repo automatically on the first session. No manual `git clone` required.

> **Merge conflicts:** If two developers push at the same time, resolve by preferring the most recent content. The append-only structure of KB files minimises conflicts in practice.

#### Multi-developer concurrent usage

The KB is designed for teams of any size pushing concurrently. Here is how each scenario is handled:

**The fundamental design decision:** `INDEX.md` contains no information that is not already in `tickets/*.md` and `shared/*.md`. It is a derived index. Because of this it is **always fully rebuilt from scratch after every pull** — not merged. This eliminates consistency problems regardless of how many developers push or in what order.

**`.gitattributes` — union merge for source files:**

The KB repo ships with a `.gitattributes` file (created on first setup) that tells git to use union merge on all KB files:

```
tickets/*.md    merge=union
shared/*.md     merge=union
INDEX.md        merge=union
```

Union merge means: instead of marking `<<<<<<< conflict` markers, git keeps all lines from **both** sides. For append-only Markdown files (each developer adds new entries, no one edits others' entries) this is always correct. The full rebuild then de-duplicates any doubled rows.

**Scenario walkthroughs:**

```
5 developers, all active:

Dev A  pushes tickets/IV-3672.md + shared update (their INDEX reflects only their work)
Dev B  pushes tickets/IV-3801.md + shared update (their INDEX reflects only their work)
Dev C  pulls → git union-merges both INDEX.md versions (all rows kept)
               → full rebuild from tickets/*.md + shared/*.md
               → INDEX.md (Palace + Master Index) now references IV-3672 AND IV-3801
               ✅ Dev C sees the complete picture

Dev D  pushes while Dev E is also pushing:
         → one push wins, the other gets rejected (non-fast-forward)
         → rejected dev does: git pull --rebase → git push
         → rebase replays their commit on top of the winner's
         ✅ Both commits preserved, no knowledge lost

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6th developer joins late and manually pushes their KB files
(without using the skill — raw git commands):

  cd $HOME/.prx/kb
  git add tickets/IV-3910.md shared/business-rules.md
  git commit -m "manual: add IV-3910 findings"
  git push origin main

→ Other developers pull on their next session
→ git union-merge keeps all rows in INDEX.md
→ full rebuild adds IV-3910 and any new shared entries to both sections of INDEX.md
✅ Manual push fully integrated — no broken state
```

**Pre-push pull (built into the push sequence):**

Before every push, the skill runs `git pull --rebase origin main` first. This replays the local KB commit on top of whatever other developers pushed during the session, preventing non-fast-forward rejections.

#### Remote existence check — safe first push

Before every push, the skill checks whether `origin/main` is reachable:

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| Remote branch exists | Normal `git push origin main` |
| Remote repo exists, branch missing (first push ever) | `git push --set-upstream origin main` — creates branch automatically |
| Remote repo unreachable (network, wrong URL) | `KB_PUSH_WARN` logged, push skipped, changes committed locally for manual push later |
| Remote repo does not exist (URL was never created) | `KB_PUSH_WARN` with instructions to create the private repo first |

No session is blocked by a push failure — the KB is always committed locally and can be pushed when connectivity is restored.

#### Memory Palace — the primary retrieval layer

The Memory Palace lives in the **`## Memory Palace` section of `INDEX.md`**. It applies the **Method of Loci** to make prior knowledge instantly recognisable. The V1 system is divided into named **Rooms** (CASE ROOM, ALERT ROOM, FRONT ROOM, ENGINE ROOM, WORKER ROOM, VAULT). Each knowledge entry has a **vivid trigger phrase** — a 5–8 word memorable anchor. Agents read the Palace section first, scan triggers for their matched rooms, and surface all relevant knowledge in ≤ 3 read operations regardless of how large the KB grows. If no Palace trigger matches, agents fall through to the `## Master Index` section of the same file.

```
System Map (loci):

   GWT Frontend (fcfrontend)      ← 🖥️  FRONT ROOM
         │ RPC
   Backend API (fcbackend)        ← 🔧 ENGINE ROOM
         │
   ┌─────┴──────────────┐
   CaseManager (FRAMS)  AlertCentral (FRAMS)  Plugin/Workers
   🏠 CASE ROOM         🚨 ALERT ROOM         ⚙️  WORKER ROOM
         └─────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                  Database (fcbuild)          ← 🗄️  VAULT
```

**Trigger examples:**
- `"resolve case → must resolve alerts"` → BIZ-001 (business rule)
- `"flag set, never reset — boolean trap"` → PAT-001 (pattern, seen 3×)
- `"resolveCase — four callers watch this"` → RISK-001 (regression risk)
- `"pendingAlertResolve drives the chain"` → ARCH-001 (architecture)

When Jordan sees a ticket touching `CaseManager`, he reads the CASE ROOM triggers and immediately recognises `"flag set, never reset"` from a previous session — before writing a single line of grep.

#### External knowledge sources

The KB query also reaches out to two live external sources:

| Source | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Confluence** (`prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki`) | Business requirements, functional specs, known limitations — queried by component/label and included in the Prior Knowledge block |
| **Bitbucket / V1 source** (`bitbucket.org/prevoirsolutionsinformatiques/insight`, `development` branch) | Live codebase — used to cross-check KB `file:line` references and confirm they are still current before the investigation team acts on them |

Confluence results appear in the Prior Knowledge block under a `CONFLUENCE` section. Stale KB references found via Bitbucket are flagged with `⚠️` so the investigation team knows to verify them in Step 5.

#### How knowledge enters the KB — inline annotation during active work

Agents do not wait until the end of a session to generate knowledge. Business rules, architecture insights, patterns, and regression risks are discovered *during* the work — while exploring code (Step 5), investigating root causes (Step 7), proposing fixes (Step 8), and reviewing diffs (Steps R4/R5). Each agent emits a lightweight `[KB+]` marker at the point of discovery:

```
[KB+ BIZ]  When resolving a case, alerts must also be resolved — Source: CaseManager.java:2272
[KB+ ARCH] AbstractXxxListener owns shared config; concrete subclass only wires getConfig()
[KB+ PAT]  Pattern #2: Boolean flag set but never reset — CaseManager.java:2310 [BUMP]
[KB+ RISK] resolveCase() called from 4 screens — changes here silently break AlertCentral
```

| Agent | What they annotate |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Morgan** | Business rules confirmed / discovered via JIRA historical search |
| **Alex** | Regression-inducing commits, historical coupling found via git blame |
| **Sam** | Domain invariants implied by data flow, component interactions |
| **Jordan** | Defensive pattern matches (NEW or BUMP), structural architecture insights |
| **Riley** | Fragile areas, untested regression surfaces, business rules from acceptance criteria |

At the end of the session, Step 13 / R9 collects every `[KB+]` marker from all steps alongside the structured session extracts. Morgan de-duplicates and confirms before writing. Nothing discovered during the session is lost.

#### Morgan's JIRA historical investigation (before every panel)

Before briefing the engineering panel, **Morgan searches JIRA for past tickets** on the same component and label that have been Closed or Resolved. This surfaces whether:
- The exact same bug has been fixed before — and where
- A prior root cause investigation exists in ticket comments
- A past fix introduced a regression that is now relevant again

```
JQL: project = IV AND component in ("{COMPONENTS}") 
     AND status in (Done, Resolved, Closed) 
     AND summary ~ "{KEY_TERM}" ORDER BY updated DESC
```

Morgan presents the results to the team as a **Historical JIRA Precedents** block before investigation begins:

```
┌─ Morgan — Historical JIRA Precedents ──────────────────────────────────┐
│ [IV-3672] (2026-03-10)  "Alerts not resolved when case is closed"      │
│   Root cause: pendingAlertResolve flag not set before save              │
│   Fix area  : CaseManager.java:2272                                    │
│   Relevance : High — same component, same symptom                      │
│                                                                        │
│ Team note: "IV-3672 is directly relevant — Jordan, check Pattern #2.   │
│            Alex, find the commit and confirm the fix area."             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This runs in **both Dev Mode (Step 7b)** and **Review Mode (Step R5a)**. If no past tickets are found or JIRA is unavailable, the investigation proceeds fresh with no interruption.

#### What gets recorded after each session

| Type | File | Sources |
|------|------|---------|
| **Ticket entry** | `tickets/IV-XXXX.md` | Root cause / fix, trigger phrase, rooms, KB annotations, verdict (review sessions) |
| **Business rules** | `shared/business-rules.md` | `[KB+ BIZ]` markers from all agents + structured Step 2/3/7 extracts + JIRA history |
| **Architecture** | `shared/architecture.md` | `[KB+ ARCH]` markers from Step 5/7/R5 + class hierarchy analysis |
| **Patterns** | `shared/patterns.md` | `[KB+ PAT NEW]` for first occurrence, `[KB+ PAT BUMP]` to increment frequency |
| **Regression risks** | `shared/regression-risks.md` | `[KB+ RISK]` from Riley and Alex, plus Step 9 usage search results |
| **INDEX.md** | `INDEX.md` | Memory Palace section: new triggers added to matched rooms, pattern frequency counters bumped. Master Index section: all new rows added and counts updated. |

#### Iterative growth in practice

```
Session 1 (IV-3672, bug)
  Step 5 : Sam emits [KB+ BIZ] → "flag must be set before save"
           Sam emits [KB+ ARCH] → "AbstractCaseListener owns flag state"
  Step 7 : Jordan emits [KB+ PAT] Pattern #2 [NEW] → CaseManager:2310
           Riley emits [KB+ RISK] → "resolveCase() called from 4 screens"
  Step 7b: Morgan JIRA search → no past tickets found
  Step 13: writes IV-3672.md, BIZ-001, ARCH-001, PAT-001 (freq:1), RISK-001
           INDEX.md (Palace): 4 triggers added to CASE ROOM + ALERT ROOM
           Push → private KB repo

Session 2 (IV-3801, review)
  Step R0: Palace query → CASE ROOM → "flag set, never reset" hits PAT-001
  Step R5a: Morgan JIRA search → finds IV-3672 (High relevance)
           "Jordan, Pattern #2 was the culprit in IV-3672 — check the diff for the same."
  Step R5b: Jordan emits [KB+ PAT] Pattern #2 [BUMP] → confirmed in diff
            Sam emits [KB+ BIZ] → BIZ-001 confirmed by diff
  Step R9 : bumps PAT-001 freq:1→2, confirms BIZ-001
            Push → private KB repo

Session 3 (IV-3910, bug)
  Step 0 : Palace → PAT-001 (freq:2) triggers immediately
  Step 7b: Morgan JIRA search → finds IV-3672 AND IV-3801 (both High)
           "Pattern #2 has occurred twice — Jordan, lead with it."
  Step 7 : Jordan confirms Pattern #2 again [BUMP]
  Step 13: bumps PAT-001 freq:2→3, adds RISK-003
           Push → private KB repo
```

After ~20 sessions: the team has a living map of every root cause, every business rule, every fragile area — discovered *during* the work, shared automatically via git, retrieved in ≤ 3 read operations via the Palace.

### PR Review Mode

When you add the word `review` before or near the ticket key, the skill switches to **PR Review Mode** and executes **10 steps**:

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **R0 — Knowledge Base** | Initialises the knowledge base if needed; after the ticket is read, queries it by components/labels and presents a Prior Knowledge block to the review panel |
| **R1 — Read Ticket** | Fetches the Jira ticket (same as Dev Mode Step 1) |
| **R2 — Understand Problem & Associated Tickets** | Analyses description, all linked/associated tickets (blocked by, blocks, relates to, cloned from, parent epics, sub-tasks), and attachments — same full analysis as Dev Mode Step 2. All linked ticket context (prior investigations, acceptance criteria changes, design decisions, regression history) is carried forward into the review panel so reviewers understand the full expected behaviour, not just the primary ticket. |
| **R3 — Read Comments** | Extracts prior investigation, decisions, and constraints from comments (same as Step 3) |
| **R4 — Fetch Code Changes** | Locates the feature branch (`Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_*`), determines the base branch using the same version logic as Dev Mode, and runs `git diff` to retrieve the full changeset |
| **R5 — Engineering Panel Code Review** | The same four-person team (Morgan, Alex, Sam, Jordan, Riley) convenes — this time as reviewers, not investigators. Each has a focused mandate: Alex reviews code quality and conventions; Sam checks logic correctness and acceptance criteria coverage; Jordan runs the full 20-pattern defensive checklist on the diff; Riley assesses test coverage, testability, and regression surface. Morgan chairs, cross-examines, scores, and delivers a binding verdict. |
| **R6 — Consolidated Review Report** | Structured findings block listing all Critical, Major, and Minor issues with `file:line` references and specific fix recommendations, followed by Positives, Test Coverage Summary, and the ordered Conditions for Approval |
| **R7 — Session Stats** | Elapsed time, estimated tokens, estimated cost |
| **R8 — PDF Review Report** | Full report saved to `{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf` using the same three-method generation sequence (pandoc → Chrome headless → HTML fallback). Report includes all step output, the consolidated findings, and the Morgan verdict. |
| **R9 — Knowledge Base Update** | Records review findings to `tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md`; confirms or flags business rules; bumps pattern frequency counters for any Jordan patterns found in the diff; adds new regression risks and architecture insights to shared files; updates both sections of `INDEX.md` (Memory Palace triggers + Master Index rows) |

#### Review Verdict

Morgan's verdict is one of four outcomes:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| ✅ **APPROVED** | No Critical or Major issues — ready to merge |
| ⚠️ **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** | No Critical issues; specific Minor/Major items must be addressed before merge |
| 🔄 **REQUEST CHANGES** | Blocking issues found — developer must resolve and re-review |
| ❌ **REJECT** | Fundamental approach is wrong or introduces unacceptable risk — rework required |

#### PDF Report Contents

The review PDF is structured in 7 sections:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **R1 — Jira Ticket** | Full field table + ticket description + attachment list |
| **R2 — Problem Understanding** | Problem statement, acceptance criteria, linked tickets, attachment findings |
| **R3 — Comments & Context** | Comment summary, Prior Investigation Summary |
| **R4 — Code Changes** | Branch/diff summary, commit log, files-changed table |
| **R5 — Engineering Panel** | Full review session — Morgan's briefing, mid-point check-in, all reviewer submissions, Riley's question + cross-examination, debate round, Morgan's scored verdict with Best Review box |
| **R6 — Consolidated Findings** | All issues (Critical/Major/Minor) with file:line and fix recommendations, Positives, Test Coverage Summary, Conditions for Approval |
| **R7 — Session Statistics** | Steps completed, elapsed time, tokens, cost, verdict, issue counts |

## Polling Script Setup

The polling script monitors Jira for tickets assigned to you with status **To Do**, **Open**, **Parked**, or **Blocked**, and triggers the dev skill automatically for any new ones found. Follow the steps for your operating system.

---

### Step 1 — Get your Jira API token

1. Log in to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Name it (e.g. `Prx Poll Jira`) and click **Create**
4. Copy the token — it will not be shown again

---

### Step 2 — Download the script files

Copy `poll-jira.sh` from this repository to your scripts folder:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
# Create the scripts folder
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts

# Copy files from this repo
cp poll-jira.sh ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/
```

**Windows (WSL terminal):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/prx-scripts
cp /mnt/c/path/to/poll-jira.sh ~/prx-scripts/
```

---

### Step 3 — Create the credentials file

Create a file named `.jira-credentials` in the same folder as `poll-jira.sh`. Replace the dummy values with your real details:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cat > ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/.jira-credentials << 'EOF'
JIRA_USER="firstname.lastname@prevoir.mu"
JIRA_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
EOF

chmod 600 ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/.jira-credentials
```

**Windows (WSL terminal):**
```bash
cat > ~/prx-scripts/.jira-credentials << 'EOF'
JIRA_USER="firstname.lastname@prevoir.mu"
JIRA_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
EOF

chmod 600 ~/prx-scripts/.jira-credentials
```

The file should look like this (dummy values shown):

```bash
JIRA_USER="john.doe@prevoir.mu"
JIRA_TOKEN="ATATT3xFfGF0tNH4BP5CQ3NHz8YraPNlH1pj1QzcsBNq4ZcG_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

> **Security:** `chmod 600` restricts the file to your user account only. Never commit this file to git — it is listed in `.gitignore`.

---

### Step 4 — Make the script executable

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.sh      # macOS / Linux
chmod +x ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh                # WSL
```

---

### Step 5 — Test it manually

Run the script once to confirm it connects to Jira and processes tickets correctly:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
bash ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

**Windows (WSL):**
```bash
bash ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

Then check the log:

```bash
tail -20 ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.log     # macOS / Linux
tail -20 ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.log               # WSL
```

Expected output for a successful run with no new tickets:

```
2026-03-25 10:00:01 Polling Jira for Parked/Blocked tickets...
2026-03-25 10:00:02 No Parked/Blocked tickets found.
2026-03-25 10:00:02 Done. 0 new ticket(s) processed.
```

Expected output when a new ticket is found:

```
2026-03-25 10:00:01 Polling Jira for Parked/Blocked tickets...
2026-03-25 10:00:02 New ticket detected: IV-3891 — starting analysis
2026-03-25 10:12:44 Analysis complete for IV-3891 (exit 0)
2026-03-25 10:12:44 Done. 1 new ticket(s) processed.
```

Common errors:

| Log message | Cause | Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| `ERROR: Credentials file not found` | `.jira-credentials` missing or wrong path | Re-run Step 3 |
| `ERROR: Jira API returned HTTP 401` | Invalid API token or wrong email | Regenerate token at id.atlassian.com |
| `ERROR: Jira API returned HTTP 403` | Account lacks access to the IV project | Ask your Jira admin to grant read access |
| `ERROR: Jira API returned HTTP 404` | Wrong Jira base URL | Verify `JIRA_BASE` in the script |

---

### Step 6 — Schedule it

#### macOS — register the launchd job

```bash
# Copy the plist
cp com.prx.poll-jira.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

# Register (starts immediately and persists across reboots)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prx.poll-jira.plist

# Verify
launchctl list | grep com.prx.poll-jira
```

Enable **Power Nap** so the job can fire while the lid is closed on mains power:
> System Settings → Battery → Options → Enable Power Nap

#### Linux — add a cron entry

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line (runs every 60 minutes):

```
0 * * * * DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus /bin/bash $HOME/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

Verify the cron entry was saved:

```bash
crontab -l
```

#### Windows — Task Scheduler

1. Open **Task Scheduler** → **Create Basic Task**
2. **Name:** `Prx Poll Jira`
3. **Trigger:** Daily → check **Repeat task every 1 hour**
4. **Action:** Start a program
   - **Program:** `wsl`
   - **Arguments:** `bash /home/<your-wsl-username>/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh`
5. On the **General** tab: select **"Run only when user is logged on"**
6. Click **Finish**

Verify by right-clicking the task → **Run** and checking the log file in WSL.

---

### Step 7 — Verify end-to-end

Once scheduled, confirm the job fires correctly by checking the log after the first scheduled run:

```bash
tail -f ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.log      # macOS / Linux (live tail)
tail -f ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.log                # WSL
```

---

## Prerequisites

### Claude Code
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed and authenticated
- Claude Code version that supports the plugin/skill system

### Jira MCP

The skill uses the **Atlassian MCP server** (`mcp-atlassian`) to read Jira tickets, download attachments, and search issues. The MCP server is configured via a `.mcp.json` file placed in the project root — this is the recommended approach as it keeps credentials local to the project and does not require the Claude Code Atlassian plugin.

#### 1. Generate a Jira API token

1. Log in to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a name (e.g. `Claude Code - V1`) and click **Create**
4. Copy the token — it will not be shown again

#### 2. Install the MCP server dependency

The MCP server runs via `uvx` (part of the `uv` Python package manager). Install `uv` if you don't have it:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

`uvx` is included with `uv` — no separate install needed.

#### 3. Create the `.mcp.json` file

A `.mcp.json.example` file is included in the repository root. Copy it and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
```

Then edit `.mcp.json` and replace the placeholder values with your real credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-atlassian"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_URL": "https://prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "your.name@prevoir.mu",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security:** `.mcp.json` is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed. Never commit a file containing a real API token.

#### 4. Verify the connection

Open a Claude Code session in the project directory and ask:
```
search for Jira issue IV-1
```

If the MCP server is configured correctly, Claude will return the issue details. If you see a tool-not-found or authentication error:
- Confirm `uvx` is on your `PATH` (`uvx --version`)
- Re-check your Jira URL, username, and API token in `.mcp.json`
- Ensure your Atlassian account has at minimum read access to the `IV` project

> **Note:** The API token grants the same permissions as your Atlassian account. The `.mcp.json` file is loaded automatically by Claude Code when you open a session in the project directory — no further setup is required.

### Git
The repository must be present at `$HOME/git/insight/` locally. The skill resolves this path dynamically at runtime using `$HOME`. The skill creates branches there.

> **Different repo location?** Open `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md` and update the `REPO_DIR` line in the **Configuration** section near the top:
> ```
> REPO_DIR = $HOME/git/insight
> ```
> Change `git/insight` to the path of your local repository relative to your home directory (e.g. `$HOME/projects/v1` or an absolute path like `/opt/repos/insight`).

### Knowledge Base (for Steps 0, 13, R0, R9)

The knowledge base is created automatically the first time the skill runs — no manual setup required for the default local mode.

#### Local mode (default — no setup needed)

The KB is stored at `$HOME/Documents/Prx/KnowledgeBase/` with no git sync and no encryption. This is the default if `PRX_KB_MODE` is not set.

```bash
# Optional: override the local KB path
export PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR="/your/custom/kb/path"
```

#### Distributed mode (team sharing via your own private repository)

To share the KB across your team, you need a **dedicated private git repository** that you own and control. Any git hosting works: company Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, internal GitLab, etc. The skill never pushes to any public repository.

**Step 1 — Create a new empty private repository on your git server.**

For example, on Bitbucket: create a new private repo called `prx-kb` in your company's workspace.

**Step 2 — Set environment variables in your shell profile** (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
export PRX_KB_MODE=distributed
export PRX_KB_REPO="git@bitbucket.org:mycompany/prx-kb.git"   # your private KB repo URL
export PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE="$HOME/.prx/kb"                      # optional: default is $HOME/.prx/kb
```

**Step 3 — Reload your shell:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

The skill clones the repo automatically on the first session. No manual `git clone` required.

> **First session:** The skill initialises the KB directory structure and pushes it to the private repo. All subsequent sessions pull the latest KB before starting.

#### Optional: add encryption (defense-in-depth)

If you want encrypted files at rest — for example, company policy requires it or you want protection if the repo is ever accidentally made public — also set:

```bash
export PRX_KB_KEY="your-strong-secret-passphrase"
```

> **Important:** Never commit `PRX_KB_KEY` to any file tracked by git. Share it with team members through a secure channel (1Password, company secrets manager, etc.).

With `PRX_KB_KEY` set, all KB files are AES-256-CBC encrypted before each push and decrypted to a session temp directory at the start of each session. Without it, plain Markdown is pushed directly — which is fine when the private repo's access controls are sufficient.

> **If `PRX_KB_REPO` is not set in distributed mode:** The skill warns you and continues without prior knowledge. No KB reads or writes are performed until the variable is set.

### PDF Generation (for Step 12 — PDF Report)

The skill tries three methods in order — no setup is required if Chrome or Chromium is already installed.

**Method 1 — pandoc (best output quality):**
```bash
# macOS
brew install pandoc

# Linux
apt install pandoc

# Windows — download installer from https://pandoc.org/installing.html
```

**Method 2 — Chrome / Chromium headless (no install needed if Chrome is present):**

No setup required. The skill detects Chrome automatically on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

**Method 3 — HTML fallback:**

If neither pandoc nor Chrome is available, the report is saved as a styled `.html` file. Open it in any browser and use **File → Print → Save as PDF**.

> Python `weasyprint` is no longer used — it has unreliable native dependencies on Windows.

Locate your Claude Code `settings.json` file:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\<username>\.claude\settings.json` |

> If the file does not exist, create it.

Add the following — replacing `<username>` with your username on Windows, or using the `~/.claude/...` path on macOS/Linux:

**macOS / Linux:**
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "prx": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "/Users/<username>/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/prx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "prx": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "C:\\Users\\<username>\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\prx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> If `extraKnownMarketplaces` already exists in your settings, add the `"prx"` entry inside it.

**Alternatively**, if you prefer to skip the manual clone and point directly to the hosted Git URL:
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "prx": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "dodogeny/prx-skill-internal-dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> Note: With this option you must also run `claude plugin marketplace update prx` before installing, to fetch the marketplace content from GitHub.

### 3. Install the plugin

```bash
claude plugin install prx@prx
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
claude plugin list
```

You should see `prx@prx` listed as installed.

### 5. Upgrading

How you upgrade depends on which registration method you used in Step 2.

#### If you registered with a local path (manual clone)

Pull the latest changes into your cloned directory, then update the plugin:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/prx pull
claude plugin update prx@prx
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git -C "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\prx" pull
claude plugin update prx@prx
```

#### If you registered with the hosted Git URL

Claude Code manages the fetch from GitHub. Just run:

```bash
claude plugin update prx@prx
```

#### Verify the upgrade

```bash
claude plugin list
```

The version number next to `prx@prx` should reflect the latest release.

## Usage

### Dev Mode — start development on a ticket

Invoke using any of these forms:

```
/prx:dev IV-3672
```
```
/dev IV-3672
```
```
start dev on IV-3672
```
```
pick up IV-3672
```
```
https://prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net/browse/IV-3672
```

Claude will immediately begin executing all 12 steps in order, presenting output for each step as it completes.

### PR Review Mode — review code changes for a ticket

Add the word `review` before or near the ticket key:

```
/prx:dev review IV-3672
```
```
/dev review IV-3672
```
```
review IV-3672
```
```
PR review IV-3672
```
```
code review IV-3672
```

Claude will execute 8 review steps and save the findings as `{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf` in the configured report folder.

> `/dev` is the shorthand — it uses just the skill name. `/prx:dev` is the fully qualified form that includes the plugin namespace. Both work; use the fully qualified form if another installed plugin also has a skill named `dev`.

── Mid-Point Check-In (T+2) ──────────────────────────────────────
Alex  (3/8 ops): Found commit abc1234 — looks like a flag removal. Diffing now.
Sam   (3/8 ops): Traced to resolveCase():2272 — save callback fires but no alert chain reached.
Jordan (1/8 ops): Pattern #2 matched immediately at CaseManager.java:2272.

Morgan: Alex, confirm whether the removal was intentional — check the commit message.
        Sam and Jordan, you're converging on the same location — finish your evidence.

── Morgan's Cross-Examination ─────────────────────────────────────
→ Alex: "The commit message says 'cleanup unused flags' — how do
   you know the removal was unintentional rather than a deliberate
   decision to disable alert resolution?"

Alex: "The linked ticket IV-3601 is about UI cleanup — no mention
   of alert behaviour. The flag is still referenced by the callback
   guard 5 lines below. If the intent was to remove alert resolution
   entirely, the guard and the callback class would also be gone."

→ Sam: "You say the callback guard `if (pendingAlertResolve)` is
   never entered. Is the callback even registered at the point
   resolveCase() is called, or does registration also need fixing?"

Sam: "The callback is registered in the constructor — it's always
   live. The only missing piece is setting the flag to true on the
   resolve path. The callback itself is wired correctly."

── Team Debate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jordan challenges Alex: "You're attributing this to a commit removal.
But if that commit was intentional at the time, restoring the flag
alone might not be enough — someone might have removed it to fix a
different bug. Sam's flow trace confirms the mechanism; mine confirms
the pattern. The history is supporting evidence, not the cause."

Alex responds: "Fair. The root cause is the missing flag on the
resolve path. The commit confirms when it disappeared. Jordan's
pattern naming is the cleaner statement. I'll defer to that framing."

Morgan: "Good. Debate closed."
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

── Morgan's Verdict ───────────────────────────────────────────────
Scores:
  Alex   : 9 / 14 pts — strong historical evidence; correctly
                         deferred after debate shows good judgment
  Sam    : 11 / 14 pts — flow trace is thorough and confirms the
                          exact mechanism; callback registration
                          question answered well under pressure
  Jordan : 12 / 14 pts — matched the pattern in 2 ops, evidence is
                          code-level and unambiguous, survived
                          Alex's implicit challenge cleanly

My assessment: All three converged on the same location and mechanism.
Jordan named it fastest with the most precise code evidence. Sam's
callback registration clarification is important — it confirms the
fix is a single-line change. Alex's commit adds useful audit trail.
The adopted root cause is Jordan's with Sam's callback note added.

ROOT CAUSE STATEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Author    : Jordan  |  Approved by: Morgan
Location  : CaseManager.java:2272
Mechanism : pendingAlertResolve flag never set true on the resolve
            path — the callback guard `if (pendingAlertResolve)`
            is never entered; alert resolution chain is never reached
Trigger   : User resolves a case via Actions → Change Status → RESOLVED
Fix dir.  : Set pendingAlertResolve = true before the save onSuccess
            and wire ScreenCallBackAlertsForResolve
Confidence: High
Team note : Callback is already registered in constructor — only the
            flag assignment is missing. Single-line fix. (Sam)

## Automated Polling (Headless Mode)

In addition to manual invocation, the skill supports a fully automated mode that polls Jira on a schedule and triggers analysis without any developer interaction.

### How it works

A shell script (`poll-jira.sh`) runs **every 60 minutes** via macOS `launchd`. It:

1. Queries Jira for tickets assigned to you with status **To Do**, **Open**, **Parked**, or **Blocked**
2. Compares against a local seen-tickets cache — skips anything already processed
3. For each new ticket, runs the skill with `AUTO_MODE=true` (analysis-only mode — see below)
4. Sends a macOS notification when analysis is complete
5. Logs all activity to `poll-jira.log`

### Headless / analysis-only mode

When `AUTO_MODE=true` is set, all interactive confirmation gates are bypassed and the skill runs end-to-end without pausing:

| Gate | Normal behaviour | Headless default |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Step 1 — MCP failure | Stop and wait for developer | Exit immediately with `HEADLESS_ERROR: {reason}` |
| Step 4 — Base branch unconfirmed | Ask developer which branch | Default to `development`; note the fallback |
| Step 4 — Branch creation | Run `git checkout -b …` | **Skipped** — reports the branch name only; no git commands run |
| Step 5 — Low file-map confidence | Stop and ask developer | Proceed with `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE — manual review required` |
| Step 6 — Low replication confidence | Stop and ask developer | Proceed with `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE — assumptions noted` |
| Step 7 — Morgan briefing *(Bug only)* | Morgan opens and assigns focus | Briefing runs automatically |
| Step 7 — Mid-point check-in *(Bug only)* | Engineers and Riley report progress to Morgan | All four submit status; Morgan responds automatically |
| Step 7 — Riley's questions + cross-examination & debate *(Bug only)* | Riley questions engineer; Morgan cross-examines; one challenge round | Runs automatically; no developer input required |
| Step 7 — Morgan's verdict *(Bug only)* | Morgan scores and declares root cause | Verdict runs automatically |
| Step 8 — Morgan fix review | Morgan vets the proposed fix | Runs automatically; rework loop runs once if needed |
| Step 8 — Apply fix prompt | Ask yes / no / partial | **Defaults to no** — proposes the fix only; no files are edited |

The full 12-step analysis still runs and the PDF report is saved to disk. The developer reviews the PDF and applies the fix manually.

### Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `poll-jira.sh` | `~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/` | Main polling script |
| `.jira-credentials` | `~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/` | API credentials (chmod 600 — owner only) |
| `.jira-seen-tickets` | `~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/` | Cache of already-processed ticket keys |
| `poll-jira.log` | `~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/` | Full run log with timestamps |
| `com.prx.poll-jira.plist` | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` | macOS launchd job — fires every 60 minutes, Power Nap compatible |

### Platform support

The script (`poll-jira.sh`) is cross-platform bash. It detects the OS at runtime and uses the appropriate notification mechanism:

| Platform | Notifications | Scheduler |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| macOS | `osascript` (built-in) | `launchd` |
| Linux | `notify-send` (`libnotify`) | `cron` |
| Windows | WSL + PowerShell balloon tip | Task Scheduler |

---

### macOS setup

The scripts are already installed and the launchd job is registered. No further setup is required.

Verify the job is loaded:

```bash
launchctl list | grep com.prx.poll-jira
```

Enable **Power Nap** so the job can fire while the lid is closed on mains power:

> System Settings → Battery → Options → Enable Power Nap

Manage the schedule:

```bash
# Disable
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prx.poll-jira.plist

# Re-enable
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prx.poll-jira.plist
```

---

### Linux setup

#### 1. Copy the script and credentials

```bash
mkdir -p ~/prx-scripts
cp poll-jira.sh ~/prx-scripts/
cp .jira-credentials ~/prx-scripts/
chmod 600 ~/prx-scripts/.jira-credentials
chmod +x ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

#### 2. Install notification support (if not already present)

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libnotify-bin

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install libnotify
```

> If `notify-send` is unavailable, the script still runs — notifications are silently skipped and all activity is logged to `poll-jira.log`.

#### 3. Schedule with cron

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run every 60 minutes:

```
0 * * * * /bin/bash $HOME/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

> **Note:** cron jobs do not inherit your desktop session, so `notify-send` may not display if `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` is not set. To fix this, add the following at the top of the cron entry:
> ```
> 0 * * * * DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus /bin/bash $HOME/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh
> ```

---

### Windows setup (via WSL)

The script runs inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Notifications appear as Windows balloon tips via PowerShell.

#### 1. Enable WSL (if not already installed)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Restart when prompted. Ubuntu is installed by default.

#### 2. Copy the script into WSL

From inside a WSL terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/prx-scripts
cp /mnt/c/path/to/poll-jira.sh ~/prx-scripts/
cp /mnt/c/path/to/.jira-credentials ~/prx-scripts/
chmod 600 ~/prx-scripts/.jira-credentials
chmod +x ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh
```

#### 3. Install dependencies inside WSL

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl python3
```

#### 4. Schedule with Windows Task Scheduler

1. Open **Task Scheduler** → **Create Basic Task**
2. Name: `Prx Poll Jira`
3. Trigger: **Daily**, repeat every **1 hour**
4. Action: **Start a program**
   - Program: `wsl`
   - Arguments: `bash /home/<your-wsl-username>/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh`
5. Finish

> Ensure the task is set to **"Run only when user is logged on"** so WSL and PowerShell notifications work correctly.

---

### Running manually (all platforms)

```bash
bash ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/poll-jira.sh        # macOS
bash ~/prx-scripts/poll-jira.sh                  # Linux / WSL
```

### Resetting the seen-tickets cache

If you want the script to re-analyse tickets it has already processed, clear the cache:

```bash
> ~/Documents/Prx/Scripts/.jira-seen-tickets       # macOS
> ~/prx-scripts/.jira-seen-tickets                 # Linux / WSL
```

> - `scripts/.jira-seen-tickets` — runtime cache of processed ticket keys
> - `scripts/poll-jira.log` / `poll-jira-error.log` — runtime logs

The entire skill logic lives in `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md`. It is a markdown file that Claude Code loads as a prompt extension when the skill is invoked. No compiled code, no runtime dependencies beyond what Claude Code provides.

## Updating the Skill

### For maintainers

Edit `plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md`, commit, and push to GitHub.

### For team members

#### Option A — Claude plugin update command (recommended)

Claude Code manages the marketplace directory internally. Always use the Claude-managed command to update — do **not** run `git pull` directly inside `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/prx` as Claude Code may wipe the folder when it detects external changes.

```bash
claude plugin update prx@prx
```

#### Option B — Reinstall (if Option A fails)

If the update command fails or the plugin appears broken:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
claude plugin uninstall prx@prx
claude plugin install prx@prx
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
claude plugin uninstall prx@prx
claude plugin install prx@prx
```

#### Verify the update

```bash
claude plugin list
```

The version number next to `prx@prx` should reflect the latest release.

---

## Contributing

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodogeny/prx-skill-internal-dev.git
```

### 2. Open in your IDE

**IntelliJ IDEA:**
- File → Open → select the cloned folder
- IntelliJ will detect it as a project automatically

**Eclipse:**
- File → Open Projects from File System → select the cloned folder
- Eclipse project files (`.project`, `.classpath`, `.settings/`) are gitignored and will be generated locally

### 3. Make your changes

All skill logic lives in a single file:

```
plugin/skills/dev/SKILL.md
```

Edit this file to modify the workflow steps, prompts, or project context.

### 4. Bump the version

When making a change, increment the version number in **all three** of the following files:

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` |
| `plugin/package.json` | `"version"` |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version"` inside the `plugins` array |

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **PATCH** (e.g. `1.0.1`) — bug fix or wording tweak
- **MINOR** (e.g. `1.1.0`) — new step or significant behaviour change
- **MAJOR** (e.g. `2.0.0`) — breaking restructure

### 5. Commit and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "vX.Y.Z — short description of change"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Notify team to update

After pushing, notify the team to run:

```bash
claude plugin update prx@prx
```

> Do **not** advise running `git pull` directly inside `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/prx` — Claude Code manages that directory and may wipe it if it detects external git changes.

## Changelog

### v1.2.1

#### Shared Knowledge Base — New Feature

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | KB — Dual storage modes | **`KB_MODE=local` (default):** KB lives in `$HOME/Documents/Prx/KnowledgeBase/` — private to one machine, no git, no encryption, zero setup. **`KB_MODE=distributed`:** KB lives in a dedicated private git repository (`PRX_KB_REPO`) that the team owns and controls. Each developer clones the repo locally; the skill pulls at session start and pushes at session end. Access is governed entirely by the private repo's permissions. |
| 2 | KB — Private dedicated repository | **No data in any public repo.** In distributed mode the KB is pushed to a separate standalone git repository (`PRX_KB_REPO`) distinct from both the product repo and the skill repo. The team can use any private git hosting: company Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, etc. This gives full access control — grant or revoke per developer independently. |
| 3 | KB — Git distribution (Steps 0a / R0a) | **Auto-pull at session start** — `git pull origin main` on the local KB repo clone. **Auto-push at session end** (Steps 13f / R9f) — `git add . && git commit && git push origin main` on the same clone. No worktrees, no orphan branches — standard git on a dedicated repo. |
| 4 | KB — Optional AES-256-CBC encryption | **`PRX_KB_KEY` (optional):** When set, all KB files are encrypted with AES-256-CBC + PBKDF2-SHA512 (310,000 iterations) before each push and decrypted to a session temp directory at session start. This provides defense-in-depth — useful if company policy requires data encrypted at rest or if there is any risk of the private repo being made public. When not set, plain Markdown is pushed directly (appropriate for well-controlled private repos). |
| 5 | KB — Memory Palace (INDEX.md) | **Primary retrieval layer using Method of Loci.** The V1 system is divided into 6 named Rooms (🏠 CASE ROOM, 🚨 ALERT ROOM, 🖥️ FRONT ROOM, 🔧 ENGINE ROOM, ⚙️ WORKER ROOM, 🗄️ VAULT) matching the system layers. Each knowledge entry has a **vivid trigger phrase** (5–8 words, memorable). The Memory Palace lives in the `## Memory Palace` section of `INDEX.md`. Agents read this section first, scan trigger tables for matched rooms, and surface all relevant knowledge in ≤ 3 read operations — regardless of KB size. Triggers are added in Steps 13d / R9d and frequency counters are bumped on pattern recurrence. |
| 6 | KB — INDEX.md (combined index) | `INDEX.md` holds both the Memory Palace (`## Memory Palace` — room trigger tables) and the Master Index (`## Master Index` — flat entry list). The Master Index is used as fallback if Palace triggers yield no matches. Greppable by component, label, ticket key, and trigger phrase. A single file replaces the former two-file design (PALACE.md + INDEX.md). |
| 7 | KB — Retrieval (Steps 0b / R0b) | **Two-layer retrieval within a single file**: (1) Palace — read `INDEX.md`, navigate to `## Memory Palace`, map ticket to rooms by component/label, scan room trigger tables; (2) Master Index fallback — grep `## Master Index` section of `INDEX.md` by component/label. Max 5 ticket entries (most recent). All matching shared entries always included. Prior Knowledge block shown to the full engineering team before investigation begins. |
| 8 | KB — External sources | **Confluence integration** — at Step 0b, queries `prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/x/uACUAw` by component/label using the Atlassian MCP to find spec pages, business rules, and known limitations; results appear in Prior Knowledge under a `CONFLUENCE` section. **Bitbucket cross-check** — KB `file:line` references are verified against the live `development` branch at `bitbucket.org/prevoirsolutionsinformatiques/insight`; stale references are flagged `⚠️` before the investigation team acts on them. |
| 9 | KB — Dev update (Steps 13b–13f) | Writes `tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md` with trigger + rooms metadata; appends to shared files; updates both sections of `INDEX.md` (Memory Palace triggers + Master Index rows); pushes to private KB repo. |
| 10 | KB — Review update (Steps R9b–R9f) | Same as Step 13 but records review verdict, confirmed/violated business rules, and QA gaps as regression risks; bumps pattern frequency counters; pushes to private KB repo. |
| 11 | KB — Iterative growth | Pattern frequency counters increment each recurrence. After 3 occurrences of the same pattern, Morgan leads with it as the primary hypothesis. Business rules accumulate and are confirmed or flagged violated across all sessions. The Memory Palace section of INDEX.md grows triggers in the correct rooms automatically. |
| 12 | KB — Headless mode | Pull, initialise, query, write, and push all run in headless mode. Push failures log `KB_PUSH_WARN:` and do not block session completion. |

#### Continuous KB Enrichment — Inline `[KB+]` Annotations

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | KB — Live annotation protocol | **Agents annotate during active work, not just at session end.** Any agent who discovers a business rule, architecture insight, pattern, or regression risk while doing code exploration, investigation, fix development, or review emits a `[KB+]` marker inline in their output at the point of discovery. Format: `[KB+ BIZ]`, `[KB+ ARCH]`, `[KB+ PAT] [NEW/BUMP]`, `[KB+ RISK]`. |
| 2 | KB — Step 5 annotations | During code location, agents emit `[KB+ ARCH]` for class hierarchy / ownership discoveries and `[KB+ RISK]` for widely-coupled classes or methods identified in the file map. |
| 3 | KB — Step 7 annotations | Each panel member has a defined annotation responsibility: Alex emits risk and arch from git history; Sam emits business rules from data flow; Jordan emits pattern matches (NEW/BUMP) for every hit in the 20-pattern checklist; Riley emits risks and business rules from her impact assessment. |
| 4 | KB — Review mode annotations | Same `[KB+]` protocol applies during Steps R4/R5. Each reviewer (Alex, Sam, Jordan, Riley) annotates inline with the same marker types, specific to what the diff reveals. |
| 5 | KB — Step 13a / R9a collection | Step 13a and R9a now collect `[KB+]` markers from the **full session output** (all steps) as the primary source, alongside structured session extracts as a fallback. Morgan de-duplicates before writing. Nothing discovered during the session is lost. |

---

#### Morgan's JIRA Historical Investigation — New Feature

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Step 7b — JIRA historical search | **Morgan searches JIRA before every engineering panel briefing.** Runs two JQL queries — component match + label match, status Closed/Resolved/Done — to find past tickets on the same area. Surfaces prior root cause analysis, fix locations, and regression warnings. |
| 2 | Step 7b — Historical Precedents block | Results are presented to the full panel as a **Historical JIRA Precedents** block before investigation begins. Each past ticket shows: status, root cause (if documented in comments), fix area (file:method), and relevance rating (High/Medium/Low). |
| 3 | Step 7b — Team guidance | If a highly relevant past fix is found, Morgan immediately directs the team: "IV-XXXX is directly relevant — Alex, find that commit. Jordan, Pattern #2 was the culprit — confirm or rule out first." If no past tickets found, the team proceeds fresh with no interruption. |
| 4 | Step 7b — KB contribution | Morgan emits `[KB+ BIZ]` and `[KB+ ARCH]` markers for any business knowledge discovered in the historical JIRA tickets that is not already in the Prior Knowledge block. |
| 5 | Step R5a — Review mode | **Same JIRA historical search runs in Review Mode** before the review panel briefing (Step R5a). Morgan presents the Historical Precedents block so reviewers know whether the diff addresses a known recurring issue. |

---

#### PR Review Mode — New Mode

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Skill — Mode Selection | **New PR Review Mode** — the skill now detects the mode from the invocation. Invoking with the word `review` near the ticket key (e.g. `review IV-XXXX`, `PR review IV-XXXX`, `/dev review IV-XXXX`) triggers PR Review Mode (Steps R1–R8). All other invocations remain Dev Mode (Steps 1–12). |
| 2 | Step R1 — Read Ticket | Fetches the Jira ticket — identical to Dev Mode Step 1 |
| 3 | Step R2 — Understand Problem | Full Step 2 analysis including all linked/associated tickets — fetches blocked-by, blocks, relates-to, cloned-from, parent epics, and sub-tasks. All linked ticket context (prior investigations, acceptance criteria changes, design decisions, regression history) is carried forward to the review panel for full expected-behaviour context. |
| 4 | Step R3 — Read Comments | Full Step 3 analysis — extracts prior investigation, decisions, and constraints |
| 5 | Step R4 — Fetch Code Changes | Locates the feature branch matching `Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_*`, determines the base branch using the same version priority logic as Dev Mode, and runs `git diff {BASE}...{FEATURE}` to retrieve the full changeset. Lists every changed file with change type and line counts. Stops if no branch or no changes are found. |
| 6 | Step R5 — Engineering Panel Code Review | The same four-person team convenes as code reviewers: Alex (code quality, naming, conventions, commit hygiene), Sam (logic correctness, acceptance criteria coverage, data flow), Jordan (full 20-pattern defensive checklist on the diff), Riley (test coverage, testability, regression surface). Same phased session: Morgan briefing → 4-min review window (8 ops for engineers, 6 for Riley) → mid-point check-in → review submissions → Riley's question + Morgan cross-examination → debate round → Morgan's verdict. |
| 7 | Step R5 — Review Scoring | 7-criterion scoring rubric (max 12 pts): code evidence (+3), actionable finding (+2), survived cross-examination (+2), corroborated finding (+2), found efficiently ≤ 5 ops (+1), debate challenge deflected (+1), testability-relevant and Riley-corroborated (+1). Morgan also gives a Best Review distinction. |
| 8 | Step R5 — Review Verdict | Four verdict outcomes: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / 🔄 REQUEST CHANGES / ❌ REJECT. Verdict is binding and includes a Coverage view (Morgan's response to Riley's test coverage assessment). |
| 9 | Step R6 — Consolidated Report | Structured findings block with all Critical, Major, and Minor issues in `[C1]`/`[M1]`/`[m1]` format — each with `file:line`, finding description, recommended fix, and which reviewer raised it. Also includes Positives, Riley's Test Coverage Assessment verbatim, and an ordered Conditions for Approval list. |
| 10 | Step R7 — Session Stats | Same format as Dev Mode Step 11 |
| 11 | Step R8 — PDF Review Report | Generates `{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf` (not `{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf`) using the same three-method generation sequence (pandoc → Chrome headless → HTML fallback). 7-section report: ticket, problem understanding, comments, code changes, full review panel session, consolidated findings, session stats. Confirmation displays the verdict and issue counts alongside the file path. |

### v1.2.0

#### Root Cause Analysis — Engineering Panel (Step 7 / SKILL)

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Step 7 — Engineering Panel | **New dedicated RCA step** — replaced single-angle analysis with a structured 4-person senior engineering panel. Morgan (Lead Developer) chairs; Alex, Sam, and Jordan (Senior Engineers) investigate independently and compete for best analysis. |
| 2 | Step 7 — Morgan (Lead Developer) | 20-yr Java/GWT/Spring/Oracle expert. Sets the investigation schedule, assigns focus areas, poses probing questions, facilitates one debate round, scores all hypotheses, and gives a binding verdict. Not competing — arbitrates. |
| 3 | Step 7 — Engineer Personas | Alex (12 yrs): git history & regression forensics — *"Every bug has a birthday."* Sam (10 yrs): runtime data flow & logic tracing — *"Follow the data to the divergence point."* Jordan (15 yrs, architect): defensive patterns & anti-patterns — *"I've catalogued every way Java devs shoot themselves in the foot."* |
| 4 | Step 7 — Phased 6-minute session | Six sequential phases: Morgan briefing (1 min) → parallel investigation (4 min) → mid-point check-in (T+2) → hypothesis submission (T+4) → cross-examination & debate (T+5–6) → Morgan's verdict (T+6). |
| 5 | Step 7 — Investigation Budget | Each engineer: 4-minute window / max 8 targeted grep-read operations. Stop-early rule triggers if High confidence evidence is found in ≤ 4 ops. Morgan may run up to 4 additional reads to independently verify contested claims. |
| 6 | Step 7 — Mid-Point Check-In (T+2) | All three engineers submit a brief progress status to Morgan mid-investigation. Morgan acknowledges, redirects off-track engineers, or calls an early stop if conclusive evidence has already been found. |
| 7 | Step 7 — Morgan Cross-Examination | After hypothesis submission, Morgan poses 1–2 targeted probing questions per hypothesis to stress-test reasoning. Engineers respond with code evidence, not opinion. |
| 8 | Step 7 — Team Debate | One round of engineer-to-engineer challenges. Any engineer may challenge another's hypothesis with specific counter-evidence; the challenged engineer responds once. Morgan moderates and closes the debate. |
| 9 | Step 7 — Competitive Scoring (max 14 pts) | 8 criteria scored by Morgan: code evidence (+3), fix direction (+2), intermittent explanation (+2), calibrated confidence (+1), independent corroboration (+2), found efficiently ≤ 5 ops (+1), survived cross-examination (+2), debate challenge deflected (+1). |
| 10 | Step 7 — Verdict outcomes | 🏆 Best Analysis (endorsement), 🤝 Consensus (joint credit), 🏆 + 📝 Refinement (Morgan improves the winning hypothesis), or ⚡ Morgan Override (independent read finds what the team missed). |
| 11 | Step 7 — Root Cause Statement | Authored by the winning engineer, approved by Morgan. Includes a Team Note capturing any debate nuance the fix author must not overlook. |
| 12 | Step 8 — Morgan Fix Review | Before the fix is applied, Morgan vets it across 5 checks: mechanism alignment, surgical scope, regression risk, team note honoured, DB safety. Verdict: ✅ Approved / ⚠️ Approved with Conditions / 🔄 Rework Required (one rework loop allowed). |
| 13 | Step 8 — Propose Fix | Root Cause Statement quoted verbatim as mandatory anchor. Each code change annotated with which mechanism it addresses. Alternative approaches table added. |
| 14 | Step 10 — Change Summary | PR description template updated to include Root Cause Statement with winning engineer attribution and Morgan's approval. |
| 15 | Steps renumbered | New dedicated RCA step inserted as Step 7 (SKILL). Old Step 7 (Propose Fix) → Step 8. Old Step 8 (Impact) → Step 9. Old Step 9 (Summary) → Step 10. Old Step 10 (Stats) → Step 11. Old Step 11 (PDF) → Step 12. Total: 12 SKILL steps. |

#### Engineering Panel — Senior Lead Tester (Riley)

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 22 | Step 7 — Team | **Riley added as Senior Lead Tester** — 18 yrs QA and test architecture for Java enterprise and GWT applications. Riley is not competing for Best Analysis — Riley challenges and assesses from a testing perspective. Riley's concerns carry weight: any High regression risk or unanswered open question must be addressed by Morgan in the verdict and Fix Review. |
| 23 | Step 7b — Briefing | **Morgan's briefing extended** — Riley receives an explicit assignment in the Lead Briefing block: map the test surface, identify affected user flows, flag edge cases the engineers may miss, and raise any testability concern with the suspected fix direction. Schedule updated to include Riley's question slot at T+5. |
| 24 | Step 7c — Investigation | **Riley's parallel impact assessment** — runs alongside engineer investigation with a capped budget of 6 operations. Riley reviews the ticket acceptance criteria, replication guide, affected file map, and all user flows passing through suspect files. Output: affected flows, edge cases, testability assessment, and one open question directed at a specific engineer or Morgan. |
| 25 | Step 7d — Mid-point check-in | **Riley added to mid-point check-in** — Riley submits a progress status alongside the three engineers. Morgan may redirect Riley's focus (e.g. "the cancel path concern is valid — include a test scenario for it"). |
| 26 | Step 7e — Assessment submission | **Testing Impact Assessment block** — Riley submits a structured assessment (hypothesis risk, affected flows, edge cases, testability, regression risk severity, open question) at T+4 alongside the engineer hypotheses. The assessment is advisory, not scored. |
| 27 | Step 7f — Cross-examination | **Riley's questions phase** — Riley poses the Open question to the named engineer before Morgan's cross-examination begins. The engineer responds with evidence. Morgan's questions follow. |
| 28 | Step 7g — Debate | **Riley can challenge in the debate round** — Riley may mount one challenge on impact or testability grounds (not code grounds). Challenge format matches engineer challenges but focuses on affected flows and regression risk. |
| 29 | Step 7h — Verdict | **Scoring rubric extended to 15 pts** — new 9th criterion: +1 if the fix direction is testable and Riley raised no High regression risk against it. Verdict block now includes a mandatory **Tester's view** paragraph where Morgan addresses Riley's assessment. Summary block includes a Riley line. |
| 30 | Step 7i — Root Cause Statement | **Tester note field added** — the Root Cause Statement now includes an optional Tester note (Riley's key concern or confirmation) that the fix author must not overlook. |
| 31 | Step 8c — Morgan Fix Review | **Seventh check added: Tester concerns** — Morgan confirms whether Riley's High/Medium impact concerns are addressed by the proposed fix, or explicitly accepts them as risk. Fix Review output block updated with `Tester concerns` field. |

#### Enhancement Workflow — Direct Analysis Path

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 32 | Step 7 — Enhancement tickets | **Engineering Panel skipped for enhancements** — when the Decision Tree classifies a ticket as Enhancement, Step 7 now routes directly to Step 7-ENH (Direct Analysis) and bypasses the full Engineering Panel. The panel (Morgan + Alex + Sam + Jordan + Riley) is for bugs only. |
| 33 | Step 7-ENH — Direct Analysis | **New four-part enhancement analysis**: (a) what needs to be added (file:line references), (b) insertion point analysis per touch point with class hierarchy check, (c) git history check confirming no partial implementation exists, (d) Enhancement Statement block that anchors Step 8 (replaces Root Cause Statement for enhancements). |
| 34 | Step 8 — Anchor | **Dual anchor support** — Step 8 now anchors to either the Root Cause Statement (bug) or Enhancement Statement (enhancement) depending on ticket type. Annotation text updated to reference the correct statement type. |

#### PDF Report — Full-Detail Capture

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 35 | Step 12 — PDF Report | **Report upgraded from placeholder to full-detail capture** — the Markdown source template (12b) now contains a structured section for every step. Each section is populated verbatim from the actual analysis output — no summaries, no abbreviations. The full Engineering Panel session (all phases: briefing, mid-point, hypotheses, Riley's assessment, cross-examination, debate, verdict, Root Cause Statement) is reproduced in the report. Enhancement tickets reproduce the full Enhancement Statement. |
| 36 | Step 12 — PDF Report | **11-section structure defined** — one section per step (Steps 1–11), each with explicit sub-headings and table/block templates matching the step's actual output format. Covers: Jira fields + description, problem statement table, comment summary + prior investigation, branch details, file map + class hierarchy, replication steps + service restart guidance, full RCA session or Enhancement Statement, full proposed fix + Morgan Fix Review, impact tables + regression risks, change summary + PR template, session statistics. |
| 37 | Step 12 — PDF Report | **README Step 12 section updated** — now includes a Report Contents table describing what is captured in each of the 11 sections, so developers know the report contains the complete analysis record. |

#### Analysis Quality — Enhancements & Abstract Class Ownership

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 16 | Step 5 — Locate Code | **Class hierarchy check (mandatory for enhancements)** — when an enhancement ticket adds new fields or methods, Claude now greps the full inheritance chain of the target class, identifies the abstract base and all sibling subclasses, and explicitly determines whether the new infrastructure belongs in the concrete class or the abstract base. The abstract base (if applicable) is added to the file map with role "Abstract base — owns shared infrastructure". |
| 17 | Step 7 — Jordan (Defensive Patterns) | **New pattern #11: Wrong Ownership Level** — Jordan now checks whether new fields, getters/setters, or utility methods are placed in the correct class. If the concrete class has an abstract base that already owns similar state, the new infrastructure belongs in the base; only `getConfig()` items and `setAttribute()` cases stay in the concrete class. Priority order updated: Enhancements → {11, 7}. |
| 18 | Step 8 — Morgan's Fix Review | **New check #6: Abstract class ownership** — Morgan now explicitly verifies whether new infrastructure added to a concrete class should be moved to its abstract base. Runs `grep "extends {AbstractBase}"` to find siblings. Fix Review output updated with new `Abstract class ownership` field. |
| 19 | Prerequisites — Jira MCP | **Replaced plugin-based MCP setup with `.mcp.json` approach** — the Atlassian MCP server is now configured via a project-level `.mcp.json` file using `uvx mcp-atlassian`. The file is gitignored. Setup instructions updated with `uv` install steps and credential template. |
| 21 | Step 7 — Jordan (Defensive Patterns) | **Pattern #1 Null Pointer expanded to 6 sub-cases** — Jordan now checks all six distinct NPE triggers: (a) service/RPC return value not null-checked, (b) `Map.get()` result used without a null guard, (c) method chain with no intermediate null guards (`a.getB().getC()`), (d) null wrapper auto-unboxed in arithmetic or boolean expression, (e) `str.equals("literal")` where `str` may be null (should be `"literal".equals(str)`), (f) enhanced `for` loop over a collection that could itself be null (distinct from pattern #5 which covers non-null but empty/unchecked collections). |
| 20 | Step 7 — Jordan (Defensive Patterns) | **Expanded checklist from 11 to 20 patterns** — nine new patterns added: #12 Resource Leak (`Closeable` not closed in exception paths), #13 Mutable Static State (non-final statics shared across servlet requests), #14 Leaking Abstraction (DAO/ORM types surfacing in service or UI layer), #15 Circular Dependency (package-level import cycles), #16 Breaking API Change (public signature change without backward-compatible overload), #17 equals/hashCode Contract Broken (one overridden without the other, or mutable field in hashCode), #18 Serialization Mismatch (field added/removed without updating `serialVersionUID` in GWT DTOs), #19 Unchecked Cast Without Guard (cast not preceded by `instanceof`), #20 Hardcoded Environment Value (IP/port/timeout baked into logic). Priority order updated: Data issues → {1, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13}; Regressions → {2, 8, 17, 18}; Enhancements → {11, 7, 16}; Architecture → {14, 15, 19, 20}. |

#### Automation & Headless Mode

| # | Area | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 16 | Skill — Headless Mode (`AUTO_MODE=true`) | All interactive gates bypass with safe defaults — branch creation and file edits are skipped; full analysis and PDF report still run |
| 17 | Headless — Morgan phases | All Morgan phases (briefing, mid-check, cross-examination, debate, verdict, fix review) run automatically with no developer input; rework loop runs once if Morgan returns REWORK REQUIRED |
| 18 | Automation — `poll-jira.sh` | New cross-platform polling script — queries Jira every 60 minutes for tickets assigned to you with status To Do, Open, Parked, or Blocked; detects OS at runtime and uses `osascript` (macOS), `notify-send` (Linux), or PowerShell balloon tip (Windows WSL) |
| 19 | Automation — `com.prx.poll-jira.plist` | macOS launchd job — fires every 60 minutes via `StartInterval`; Power Nap compatible when plugged in; logs stdout and stderr to separate files |
| 20 | Automation — `.jira-credentials` | Credentials file (chmod 600, gitignored) — keeps Jira API token and email out of the script body |
| 21 | README — Automated Polling section | New section documenting headless mode, polling script, file locations, cross-platform setup, and cache management |

---

### v1.1.0

| # | Step | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Step 1 — Ingest Ticket | Field restriction — fetches only 13 specific fields; skips sprint, epic, watcher, and changelog data to reduce token usage |
| 2 | Step 1 — Ingest Ticket | MCP failure guard — stops on auth error / ticket not found / MCP unavailable and gives recovery instructions before proceeding |
| 3 | Step 2 — Analyse & Contextualise | Draw.io issue diagram — generates a happy-path vs broken-path `.drawio` diagram for non-trivial flows; auto-skips for single-file bugs |
| 3a | Step 2 — Analyse & Contextualise | Linked ticket context — fetches all associated/linked tickets (blocked by, relates to, cloned from, parent epics, sub-tasks) and extracts prior findings, design decisions, and acceptance criteria to enrich analysis; applies same attachment rules to linked ticket files |
| 4 | Step 3 — Create Branch | Feature/Release branch search — checks for `Feature/Release_{VERSION}` before falling back to the plain version branch |
| 5 | Step 3 — Create Branch | Base branch confirmation gate — verifies branch exists locally or remotely before any `git checkout`; asks developer if not found |
| 6 | Step 4 — Locate Code | Grep-first, read-second rule — explicitly forbids speculative full-file reads; token cost rationale documented |
| 7 | Step 4 — Locate Code | Recent git history column added to file map — runs `git log --oneline -3` per primary file |
| 8 | Step 4 — Locate Code | Confidence gate — Low confidence stops and asks; Medium flags assumption and proceeds |
| 9 | Step 5 — Replicate Issue | Replication confidence gate — Low stops and asks; Medium proceeds with explicit flag |
| 10 | Step 5 — Replicate Issue | Service restart guidance — tells developer which spawner/service to restart per layer (plugin, backend, frontend) |
| 11 | Step 7 — Propose Fix | DB migration scripts explicitly cover both Oracle (`.sql`) and PostgreSQL (`.pg`) |
| 12 | Step 8 — Change Summary | PR description template added — fully populated pull request body ready to paste (Jira link, branch, risk, test steps, retest areas, DB migration flag) |
| 13 | Step 10 — Session Stats | New step — prints elapsed time, estimated token count, and estimated cost at Sonnet 4.6 pricing |
| 14 | Step 11 — PDF Report | Temp file cleanup — removes `/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md` and `.html` after report is saved |
| 15 | Step 11 — PDF Report | Default output folder updated to `$HOME/Documents/DevelopmentTasks/Claude-Analyzed-Tickets/` |
