# Prevoir Dev Workflow Skill

Full end-to-end developer onboarding workflow for V1 Jira tickets. Guides Claude through reading, understanding, branching, locating, and fixing a reported issue or enhancement.

## Configuration

Before executing any step, resolve the following variable by running `echo $HOME` via Bash:

```
REPO_DIR = $HOME/git/insight
```

Use `REPO_DIR` wherever the repository path is referenced throughout this skill.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when the developer provides:
- A Jira ticket URL: `https://prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net/browse/IV-XXXX`
- A Jira ticket key: `IV-XXXX`
- A phrase like `/prevoir:dev IV-3672` or `/dev IV-3672` or "start dev on IV-3672" or "pick up IV-3672"

Do NOT invoke for general code questions, PR reviews, or questions unrelated to starting work on a Jira ticket.

## Workflow Steps

Execute all steps **in order**. Do not skip steps. Present output to the developer as you complete each one.

---

### Step 1 — Read the Jira Ticket

Use `mcp__jira__get_issue` with the ticket key extracted from the input. Request only the fields needed: `summary`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `status`, `assignee`, `reporter`, `labels`, `components`, `fixVersions`, `versions`, `description`, `comment`, `attachment`. Do not fetch sprint metadata, change logs, epic links, or watcher lists.

**If the MCP call fails** (authentication error, ticket not found, MCP server not running):
- State the exact error returned
- Do not proceed to Step 2
- Instruct the developer to verify: (1) the Atlassian MCP is running, (2) the API token is valid, (3) the ticket key is correct
- Stop here until the developer confirms the issue is resolved

Display:
- **Summary** (ticket title)
- **Type** (Story / Bug / Support / Task)
- **Priority**
- **Status**
- **Assignee** and **Reporter**
- **Labels** and **Components**
- **Fix Version** (target release)
- **Full description** — extract all text from the ADF body content

---

### Step 2 — Understand the Problem

Analyse the description and produce a concise internal summary:

- **What is the problem / enhancement?** (1–2 sentences)
- **Who is affected?** (which user role, client, or system)
- **What is the expected behaviour?**
- **What is the current (broken/missing) behaviour?**
- **Acceptance criteria** — list each criterion clearly

If the ticket type is a **Bug**, explicitly state:
> "This is a defect — the system is doing X but should be doing Y."

If the ticket type is a **Story/Enhancement**, explicitly state:
> "This is an enhancement — the system currently lacks X; we need to add Y."

#### Diagnostic Artefact Analysis

Download and analyse all qualifying attachments from the ticket. Apply these rules:

| Attachment type | Size limit | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Images / screenshots | ≤ 10 MB | Describe visually — UI state, error messages, highlighted fields |
| Log files (`.log`, `.txt`) | ≤ 10 MB | Scan for stack traces, exceptions, and error patterns |
| Thread dumps (`.tdump`, `.txt` with thread stacks) | ≤ 10 MB | Full analysis — see below |
| Memory / heap dumps (`.hprof`, `.heap`) | ≤ 10 MB | Full analysis — see below |
| XML / config files | ≤ 10 MB | Check for relevant config values, malformed entries |
| draw.io diagrams (`.drawio`, `.xml`) | ≤ 10 MB | Describe the flow depicted |
| Binary files, archives (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.war`, `.class`) | any | Skip — state "skipped (binary/archive)" |
| Any file > 10 MB | — | Skip — state "skipped (exceeds 10 MB limit)" |

For each attachment analysed, state its filename, type, size, and a one-line summary of what was found before the detailed analysis below.

---

**Screenshots / Images:**
- Describe the UI state visible — screen name, error banners, field values, highlighted rows
- Note any error codes, HTTP status, or modal messages visible in the screenshot

**Thread Dumps** (`.tdump`, `.txt`, `.log` files containing thread stack traces):
- Identify threads in `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, or `TIMED_WAITING` state
- Look for deadlock indicators (threads waiting on locks held by each other)
- Extract the top stack frames from the relevant thread — note the class and method at the point of contention
- Summarise: "Thread `X` is blocked at `ClassName.method():line` waiting for lock held by thread `Y`"

**Memory Dumps / Heap Dumps** (`.hprof`, `.heap`, OOM log excerpts):
- Identify the object type dominating heap usage
- Note the `OutOfMemoryError` message and which heap space was exhausted (heap, metaspace, stack)
- Extract any GC log patterns if present (frequent full GCs, long pause times)
- Summarise: "Heap exhausted by `N` instances of `ClassName` — likely a retention/leak in `FlowX`"

**Application / Server Logs** (`.log`, stack trace excerpts in description or attachments):
- Extract the full exception chain (root cause first)
- Note the first application frame in the stack trace (below any framework frames)
- Note timestamps and whether the error is intermittent or consistent
- Summarise: "`NullPointerException` at `ClassName.method():line` — triggered when `condition`"

**XML / Config Files:**
- Identify the config type (worker config, routing rule, datasource, etc.)
- Note any values that appear incorrect, missing, or relevant to the reported issue

If no attachments are present, state: "No attachments found — proceeding from description only."
If attachments are present but none are qualifying types, state: "Attachments present but all skipped (binary/archive or exceeds 10 MB)."

Carry all findings forward into the **Prior Investigation Summary** in Step 3 and the **Root Cause Analysis** in Step 7.

#### Issue Diagram (optional)

For issues involving a **non-obvious data flow or multi-step component interaction** (e.g. a race condition, a cross-layer call chain, a plugin → backend → DB path), generate a draw.io XML diagram and save it to `/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-diagram.drawio`.

The diagram should show:
- The **happy path** (what should happen) as a green flow
- The **broken path** (what actually happens) as a red flow
- Key method calls and data values annotated at each transition point

State: `Diagram saved to /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-diagram.drawio`

**Skip this diagram automatically for** trivial single-file bugs, simple null checks, or straightforward field additions where the flow is self-evident from the code. State: `Diagram skipped — single-file change, flow is self-evident.`

---

### Step 3 — Read Comments for Additional Context

Use `mcp__jira__get_comments` to fetch all comments on the ticket.

Summarise:
- Any clarifications from the reporter or PO
- Decisions made in comments that affect implementation
- Known constraints, edge cases, or related tickets mentioned
- Any prior investigation or partial fixes already done

If there are no comments, state: "No comments — proceed from description only."

#### Prior Investigation Carry-Forward

If any comments contain previous investigation work (root cause findings, code traces, attempted fixes, identified files, test results, or partial solutions), extract and explicitly carry these forward as **known context** for Steps 5, 6, and 7. Do not re-investigate what has already been established.

Produce a **Prior Investigation Summary** block if applicable:

```
Prior Investigation Summary:
- Root cause identified: [what was found]
- Files already identified: [list]
- Attempted fixes: [what was tried and outcome]
- Confirmed working / not working: [what was already validated]
- Remaining unknowns: [what is still unresolved]
```

This summary must be referenced in Step 7 (Propose the Fix) — build the solution on top of what is already known rather than starting from scratch.

---

### Step 4 — Create the Development Branch

#### 4a. Determine the Base Branch

Use the following priority order to determine the base branch:

1. **Fix Versions is set** → derive the version string (e.g. `1.24.292` from `1.24.292.p1`), then check whether a release feature branch exists:
   ```bash
   git branch --list "Feature/Release_{VERSION}" && git branch -r | grep "Feature/Release_{VERSION}"
   ```
   - If `Feature/Release_{VERSION}` exists (locally or remotely) → fork from it, so the fix builds on top of any release-level work already in progress
   - If not found → fork from the plain version branch (e.g. `1.24.292`)
2. **Fix Versions is empty, Affected Versions is set** → fork from the plain version branch (e.g. `1.24.292`)
3. **Both are empty** → fork from `development`

| Version value          | Feature/Release branch found? | Base branch to use              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Not set / empty        | —                            | `development`                   |
| e.g. `1.24.292.p1`    | Yes (`Feature/Release_1.24.292`) | `Feature/Release_1.24.292`  |
| e.g. `1.24.292.p1`    | No                           | `1.24.292`                      |
| e.g. `1.24.292`        | Yes                          | `Feature/Release_1.24.292`      |
| e.g. `1.24.292`        | No                           | `1.24.292`                      |

Rule: Strip any suffix after the third version segment (e.g. `.p1`, `.hotfix`) — always use the base `major.minor.patch` format as the version string.

**Base branch confirmation gate:** Before running any `git checkout` or `git checkout -b` command, verify the chosen base branch exists either locally or on the remote:
```bash
git branch --list {BASE_BRANCH}
git branch -r | grep "origin/{BASE_BRANCH}"
```
If it cannot be confirmed in either location, **stop and ask the developer** which branch to use rather than silently forking from a stale or incorrect HEAD.

State clearly which base branch will be used and why before running any git command.

#### 4b. Determine the Feature Branch Name

Use this format:
```
Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Ticket_Summary_Title_Case_Underscored}
```

Rules:
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Remove special characters (except underscores)
- Title-case each word
- Keep it under 80 characters total
- Prefix always `Feature/`

Example: `IV-3672` + "Resolving Cases should Resolve Alerts"
→ `Feature/IV-3672_Resolving_Cases_Should_Resolve_Alerts`

#### 4c. Create the Branch

Run the following commands **in the repository working directory** (`{REPO_DIR}/`):

First, check if the base branch exists locally:

```bash
git branch --list {BASE_BRANCH}
```

- **If the branch exists locally** — check it out directly, no remote sync:
  ```bash
  git checkout {BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Formatted_Title}
  ```

- **If the branch does NOT exist locally** — fetch it from remote first, then fork:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin {BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b {BASE_BRANCH} origin/{BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Formatted_Title}
  ```

Confirm the branch was created and is checked out.

---

### Step 5 — Locate Affected Code

Based on the ticket description, comments, and labels, search the codebase at `{REPO_DIR}/` to identify:

1. **Primary files likely affected** — use Grep/Glob to locate relevant classes, methods, or config
2. **Entry point** — where does the flow start? (API endpoint, UI event handler, worker, scheduled job)
3. **Data flow** — trace the relevant path through the layers (Frontend → API → DataSource → DB, or Worker → Plugin → etc.)
4. **Related files** — any model, DTO, or DB script changes that will likely be needed

#### Grep-First, Read-Second Rule (mandatory)

Never read an entire source file speculatively. Always follow this sequence:

1. `Grep` for the relevant class name, method name, or keyword → get the exact file path and line number
2. `Read` only the relevant line range (the method ± ~20 lines of surrounding context)
3. Only read the full file if the method spans many lines or the grep result is ambiguous

Reading a 40-line method costs ~60 tokens. Reading a 2,000-line Java file costs ~3,000 tokens. Apply this discipline to every file in this step and in Step 7.

Use the ticket **Labels** and **Components** as hints:
- `CaseManager` → `fcfrontend/.../view/CaseManager.java`
- `AlertCentral` → `fcfrontend/.../view/AlertCentral.java` and backend alert APIs
- `FRAMS` → case/alert related backend in `fcbackend/src/main/java/com/fc/api/`
- `Plugin`/`Worker` → `fcplugin/src/main/java/com/fc/plugin/`
- DB changes → `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/`

Present a **file map** — list each file with its role, the specific method or line range identified, and recent git history for primary files:

| File | Role | Key Location | Recent Git History |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Primary fix target | `resolveCase():2272` | Last modified: 3 days ago by Javed — "IV-3641 fix alert sync" |

To populate the Recent Git History column, run:
```bash
git log --oneline -3 -- {file_path}
```

#### Confidence Gate

After building the file map, assess your certainty:

- **High** — the relevant class, method, and line number are confirmed via grep → proceed automatically
- **Medium** — file identified but exact method is ambiguous; note the assumption and proceed, flagging it clearly
- **Low** — cannot locate the relevant code with reasonable certainty → **stop and ask the developer** for guidance before continuing to Step 6

State the confidence level explicitly: `File map confidence: High — proceeding.`

---

### Step 6 — Replicate the Issue

Based on the ticket description, comments, and located code, produce clear step-by-step reproduction instructions that any developer on the team can follow to observe the problem firsthand before attempting a fix.

#### 6a. Prerequisites
List everything needed before reproduction can begin:
- Required modules / spawners that must be running (e.g. Case Service, Alert Scanner)
- Specific user roles or permissions needed
- Test data that must exist (e.g. a case with open alerts, a specific alert type)
- Environment notes (e.g. Oracle vs Postgres, specific config flags)

#### 6b. Reproduction Steps
Number each step. Be explicit — do not assume prior knowledge:

```
1. Log in as a user with [role] permissions.
2. Navigate to [Screen] via [Menu path].
3. [Perform action — e.g. "Select a case with at least 2 open alerts in Alert Central."]
4. [Perform the triggering action — e.g. "Use the Actions dropdown → Change Status → RESOLVED."]
5. Navigate to Alert Central and search for the alerts that were in the case.
```

#### 6c. Expected Result
State clearly what **should** happen if the system were working correctly.

#### 6d. Actual Result (the bug / gap)
State clearly what **actually** happens — the symptom the reporter sees.

#### 6e. Replication Confidence
Rate how confidently this replication guide reflects the issue:
- **High** — reproduction steps are fully derived from ticket + code analysis → proceed automatically
- **Medium** — some assumptions made; note the assumption, proceed, and flag it clearly
- **Low** — limited information in ticket → **stop and ask the developer** to clarify before continuing to Step 7

If confidence is Medium or Low, list the specific unknowns or assumptions made.

#### 6f. Service Restart Guidance

If the fix touches the **Plugin or Worker layer** (`fcplugin/`), state which spawner or service must be restarted locally to pick up the change:

```
To test this fix locally, restart:
  - [Spawner/Worker name] — e.g. "CaseResolutionWorker" or "AlertScannerWorker"
  - Any dependent service that loads the plugin at startup
```

If the fix touches only the **GWT Frontend** (`fcfrontend/`), state: `Frontend-only change — recompile GWT module; no backend restart required.`

If the fix touches only the **Backend API** (`fcbackend/`), state: `Backend-only change — restart the application server (Tomcat/embedded).`

If the fix touches **multiple layers**, list each service that needs restarting in the correct order.

---

### Step 7 — Propose the Fix

Read the identified files and produce:

#### 7a. Root Cause Analysis
- Explain **why** the bug occurs or **why** the feature is missing
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers
- Be precise: "The issue is in `CaseManager.java:2272` — the flag is only set when..."

#### 7b. Proposed Solution
- Describe the approach before showing code
- Show **only the code that needs to change** (diff-style or clear before/after blocks)
- Explain each change and why it's needed

#### 7c. Apply Fix to Feature Branch (Interactive)

After presenting the proposed solution, ask the developer:

> **Would you like me to apply these changes to the feature branch now?**
> - `yes` — apply all proposed changes directly to the files on the current feature branch
> - `no` — skip; the developer will apply manually
> - `partial` — ask which specific changes to apply

If the developer answers **yes** or **partial**:
- Use the Edit tool to apply changes to each identified file
- After each file is modified, confirm: "Applied change to `{file}:{line}`"
- Do NOT commit — leave the changes staged for the developer to review and commit using the suggested message from Step 9c

If the developer answers **no**, continue to Step 8 without modifying any files.

#### 7d. DB Migration (if needed)
If the fix requires schema changes, provide the upgrade script template:
```sql
-- v1.XX.XXX.sql / .pg
-- IV-XXXX: <description>
ALTER TABLE ...
```

---

### Step 8 — Impact Analysis

Assess the full consequences of the proposed fix across the entire application. This step requires active codebase searching — do not rely on assumptions. Use Grep to find every reference to changed symbols before drawing conclusions.

#### 8a. Files Changed
List every file touched by the fix with a one-line description of what changed and why:

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Added `pendingAlertResolve` flag and async callback chain | Core fix for alert resolution |
| `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/v1.XX.XXX.sql` | New table / column | Schema required for fix |

#### 8b. Usage Reference Search (mandatory)

For **every method, class, field, or API endpoint** modified by the fix, search the full codebase for all callers and references:

```
Grep: {modified method or class name} → across {REPO_DIR}/
```

For each symbol changed, produce a reference table:

| Symbol Changed | Type | Callers / References Found | Files |
|----------------|------|---------------------------|-------|
| `resolveAlertCentral(...)` | method | 3 callers | `CaseManager.java`, `AlertCentral.java`, `CaseDetailsPanel.java` |
| `pendingAlertResolve` | field | local to `CaseManager` | `CaseManager.java` only |

Rules:
- If a changed method is `public` or `protected` — always search for all callers across the full repo
- If a changed method is `private` — confirm it is only called within the same class
- If a changed interface or abstract method — find all implementing classes
- If a DB column or table is changed — grep for all SQL references and ORM mappings to that table/column
- If a GWT RPC service method signature changes — find all client call sites and the corresponding server-side implementation

#### 8c. Application-Wide Impact

Based on the usage reference search, describe the impact across each application layer:

| Layer | Impact | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GWT Frontend | e.g. Medium | `CaseManager` change affects resolve flow; 2 other panels call same service |
| Backend API | e.g. Low | No API signature change; internal logic only |
| Plugin / Workers | e.g. None | No worker classes reference changed code |
| DB / Schema | e.g. High | Column rename affects 4 SQL queries across 3 upgrade scripts |
| Shared Utilities | e.g. Low | `RecordHelper` change only affects timed-wait resume path |

If a layer is not affected, state "None — confirmed by grep (0 references found)."

#### 8d. Regression Risks
For each change, identify what existing behaviour could break:
- Which existing flows pass through the modified code?
- Could the DB change affect existing data or other screens that read the same table?
- Flag any race conditions, null pointer risks, or async timing concerns introduced
- Flag any callers found in 8b that may behave differently after the change

#### 8e. Affected Clients / Environments
State whether the fix is:
- **Generic** — affects all clients running this version
- **Client-specific** — only affects a named client (e.g. FNB, VCL, DRC) due to config or data differences
- **DB-specific** — behaviour differs between Oracle and PostgreSQL implementations

#### 8f. Related Areas to Retest
List screens, flows, or features outside the primary fix that should be smoke-tested — derived from the callers found in 8b:
- e.g. "Alert Central resolve button should still work independently"
- e.g. "Case Details tab resolve should behave the same as All Cases tab"

#### 8g. Risk Level

Rate the overall risk of the change based on the usage reference search results:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Low** | Change is isolated; 0–1 callers found; no shared utilities or DB touched; easy to revert |
| **Medium** | 2–5 callers found; touches shared logic or a secondary screen; regression testing recommended |
| **High** | 6+ callers found; modifies a public API, shared utility, or DB schema; thorough QA required before release |

State the rating prominently:

> **Risk Level: Medium** — 3 callers of `resolveAlertCentral` found across 2 screens; existing Alert Central resolve path must be retested.

---

### Step 9 — Change Summary

Produce a concise, developer-friendly summary of everything that was done. This serves as a reference for commit messages, PR descriptions, and handover notes.

#### 9a. Files Touched

List every file modified, created, or deleted by the fix:

| File | Action | Summary of Change |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Modified | Added alert resolution chain triggered on case resolve |
| `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/v1.XX.XXX.sql` | Created | Added new table `B_TR_TASK_RESPONSES` |

#### 9b. What Was Changed and Why

For each file, one short paragraph explaining:
- What was changed (the what)
- Why it was necessary to make this change (the why)
- Any notable decisions or trade-offs made

#### 9c. Suggested Commit Message

Provide a ready-to-use commit message following the project convention:

```
{VERSION}_{TICKET_KEY} {Short description of fix}

- {Bullet point of key change 1}
- {Bullet point of key change 2}
```

Example:
```
IV3672_Resolving_Cases_should_Resolve_Alerts_1.26.064 IV3672 Mustakeem Lee

- Added pendingAlertResolve flag to trigger alert resolution after case save
- Added ScreenCallBackAlertsForResolve to fetch and filter unresolved alerts
- Added ScreenCallBackResolveAlerts to finalise resolution via resolveAlertCentral
```

#### 9d. PR Description Template

Provide a ready-to-paste pull request description:

```
## {TICKET_KEY} — {Ticket Summary}

**Jira:** https://prevoirsolutions.atlassian.net/browse/{TICKET_KEY}
**Branch:** {feature branch name}
**Base:** {base branch}
**Risk:** {Low / Medium / High} — {one-line justification from Step 8g}

---

## What changed
{One paragraph describing the fix — the what and the why}

## Files changed
{Files touched table from Step 9a — abbreviated to file name and one-line summary}

## How to test
{Reproduction steps from Step 6b, rewritten as a verification checklist}

## Retest areas
{Retest checklist from Step 8f}

## DB migration required
{Yes — run v1.XX.XXX.sql/.pg before deploying | No}
```

---

### Step 10 — Session Stats

Print a single summary line covering elapsed time, estimated token usage, and estimated cost at current Sonnet 4.6 pricing:

```
{TICKET_KEY} | ~{N}m elapsed | ~{X} in / ~{Y} out tokens | est. cost ${Z} (Sonnet 4.6)
```

Pricing reference (Sonnet 4.6 as of skill version 1.1.0):
- Input: $3.00 / 1M tokens
- Output: $15.00 / 1M tokens

Estimate token counts from the volume of content processed (Jira fields, attachments, file reads, analysis produced). These are approximations — label them clearly with `~`.

Example:
```
IV-3672 | ~14m elapsed | ~5,100 in / ~2,040 out tokens | est. cost $0.0462 (Sonnet 4.6)
```

---

### Step 11 — Generate PDF Analysis Report

After Step 9 is complete, generate a full PDF report of the analysis and save it to disk.

#### 11a. Configuration

Resolve the output folder using this priority order:

1. If the environment variable `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` is set, use it
2. Otherwise default to: `$HOME/Documents/DevelopmentTasks/Claude-Analyzed-Tickets/`

```bash
REPORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR:-$HOME/Documents/DevelopmentTasks/Claude-Analyzed-Tickets}"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR"
```

#### 11b. Generate Markdown Source

Write a temporary Markdown file at `/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md` containing the full analysis from all steps:

```
# {TICKET_KEY} — {Ticket Summary}

**Date:** {today's date}
**Branch:** {feature branch name}
**Analyst:** Claude (Prevoir Dev Skill v1.1.0)

---

## Step 1 — Jira Ticket

```

#### 11c. Convert to PDF

Try each method in order, stopping at the first that succeeds. These methods work reliably on macOS, Linux, and Windows without platform-specific library dependencies.

**Method 1 — `pandoc` (preferred, best cross-platform support):**

Check if pandoc is available:
```bash
which pandoc        # macOS / Linux
where pandoc        # Windows
```

If available, convert directly from Markdown to PDF:
```bash
pandoc /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md \
  -o "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" \
  --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf \
  -V geometry:margin=2cm \
  -V fontsize=11pt
```

If `wkhtmltopdf` is not available, try the HTML intermediary instead:
```bash
pandoc /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md \
  -o /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html \
  --standalone --metadata title="{TICKET_KEY} Analysis"
```
Then proceed to Method 2 to print the HTML to PDF.

> **Install pandoc:** https://pandoc.org/installing.html — available via `brew install pandoc` (macOS), `apt install pandoc` (Linux), or the Windows installer.

**Method 2 — Chrome / Chromium headless (no install required if Chrome is present):**

Check for a browser:
```bash
# macOS
which google-chrome || which chromium || \
  ls "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" 2>/dev/null

# Linux
which google-chrome || which chromium-browser || which chromium

# Windows (PowerShell)
where chrome
```

First convert the Markdown to a styled HTML file:
```python
python3 -c "
import markdown2, pathlib
md = pathlib.Path('/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md').read_text()
html = '''<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\">
<style>
  body{font-family:Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;margin:40px;line-height:1.7;color:#222}
  h1{color:#1a1a2e}h2{color:#16213e;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px}
  pre{background:#f4f4f4;padding:12px;border-radius:4px;overflow-x:auto}
  code{background:#f4f4f4;padding:2px 5px;border-radius:3px}
  table{border-collapse:collapse;width:100%}
  th,td{border:1px solid #ccc;padding:8px;text-align:left}
  th{background:#f0f0f0}
  blockquote{border-left:4px solid #ccc;margin:0;padding-left:16px;color:#555}
</style></head><body>''' + markdown2.markdown(md, extras=['fenced-code-blocks','tables','strike']) + '</body></html>'
pathlib.Path('/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html').write_text(html)
"
```

Then print to PDF using Chrome headless:
```bash
# macOS

**Method 3 — HTML fallback** (if neither pandoc nor Chrome are available):

Save the styled HTML file produced in Method 2 directly to the report folder:
```bash
cp /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html"
```

Inform the developer:
> "PDF generation unavailable (pandoc and Chrome not found). Report saved as HTML instead. Open in any browser and use File → Print → Save as PDF to convert manually."

#### 11d. Archive and Confirm

After saving, display the following to the developer (always show both the folder and the full file path):

```
📄 Analysis Report Generated
   Folder : {REPORT_DIR}/
   File   : {REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf
   Format : PDF  ← (or "HTML (PDF libraries unavailable)" if Method 3 was used)
```

#### 11e. Temp File Cleanup

After the report is confirmed saved, remove the intermediate temp files:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html
```

If removal fails, note it but do not treat it as a blocking error.

Then end with:

> **Ready to code.** Branch is created. Start with `{primary file}:{line number}`. Refer to Step 9 for the change summary and suggested commit message when done.
