description: "\"Structured Jira-driven developer workflow skill. Supports two modes — (1) Dev mode: use when a developer provides a Jira ticket URL or ticket key (e.g. PROJ-1234) and wants to start development work; handles the full workflow from reading the Jira ticket to proposing a code fix. (2) PR Review mode: use when a developer wants to review code changes for a Jira ticket; analyses the ticket context plus all code changes on the associated feature branch, then outputs findings and recommendations as a PDF report.\""

## Configuration

Before executing any step, resolve the following variables. Run `echo $PRX_REPO_DIR` via Bash to confirm it is set — if it is empty, stop immediately and tell the developer: `PRX_REPO_DIR is not set. Add it to your .env file: PRX_REPO_DIR=/absolute/path/to/your/repo`

```
REPO_DIR       = ${PRX_REPO_DIR}   ← set via PRX_REPO_DIR in .env

KB_MODE        = ${PRX_KB_MODE:-local}
                 ┌─ local        → KNOWLEDGE_DIR = ${PRX_KNOWLEDGE_DIR:-$HOME/.dev-skill/knowledge-base}
                 └─ distributed  → KNOWLEDGE_DIR = ${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}

PRX_KB_REPO        = (required when KB_MODE=distributed — URL of the team's dedicated private KB repository)
                          e.g.  git@bitbucket.org:mycompany/prx-kb.git
                                https://github.com/mycompany/prx-kb.git
PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE = (optional — local clone path for the KB repo; default: $HOME/.dev-skill/kb)
PRX_KB_KEY         = (optional when KB_MODE=distributed — AES-256-CBC passphrase for defense-in-depth
                          encryption; omit to push plain Markdown to the private repo)

PRX_SOURCE_REPO_URL = (optional — hosted URL of your codebase, e.g. https://github.com/myorg/myrepo
                          Used to cross-check KB file:line references against the live branch.
                          Omit to skip the cross-check.)

PRX_EMAIL_TO       = (optional — recipient address; if set, the report is emailed after saving)
PRX_SMTP_HOST      = (required when PRX_EMAIL_TO is set — SMTP server hostname, e.g. smtp.gmail.com)
PRX_SMTP_PORT      = (optional — SMTP port; default: 587)
PRX_SMTP_USER      = (required when PRX_EMAIL_TO is set — SMTP login username)
PRX_SMTP_PASS      = (required when PRX_EMAIL_TO is set — SMTP password or app password)

PRX_ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB = (optional — maximum attachment size in MB to download and analyse; default: 0 = no limit.
                             Images/screenshots are always read regardless of this setting.
                             Set to e.g. 10 to skip attachments larger than 10 MB.)

AUTO_MODE          = (optional — Y/YES/true to bypass all interactive prompts and permission gates and run
                             the full workflow automatically; default: N. In auto mode the skill applies safe
                             defaults at every gate, does not ask for confirmation, and automatically applies
                             the proposed fix to the newly created feature branch.)

PRX_JIRA_PROJECT   = (optional — Jira project key used to scope ticket polling (e.g. IV).
                             When set, poll-jira.sh adds `project = {PRX_JIRA_PROJECT}` to the JQL filter
                             so only tickets from that project trigger analysis. Omit to poll all projects.)

PRX_REPORT_VERBOSITY      = (optional — controls terminal output verbosity; default: full.
                               full    → every structured block, all panel dialogue, verbatim debate rounds
                               compact → structured blocks intact (Root Cause, Enhancement Statement, Fix,
                                         Morgan's verdicts) but panel narrative condensed to bullet summaries;
                                         the PDF always contains full content regardless of this setting
                               minimal → structured blocks only — no panel narrative, no debate, no check-ins)

PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED         = (optional — enable Bryan's Scrum Master retrospective (Step 14 / R10);
                               default: N. Set to Y/YES/true to activate. When N, Steps 14 and R10
                               are skipped entirely and no process-efficiency.md entry is written.)

PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS    = (optional — number of sessions with an approved change before Bryan pushes to
                               the plugin repo main branch; default: 3. Set to 1 to push after every session.
                               Only relevant when PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y.)

PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL = (optional — number of sessions between full SKILL.md compaction passes; default: 10.
                               On a compaction session Bryan runs a deep review of the entire SKILL.md to eliminate
                               redundancy, compress verbose prose, and remove dead weight — requires all five team
                               members to approve. Only relevant when PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y.)

PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET        = (optional — monthly Claude subscription budget in USD; default: 20.00.
                               Bryan tracks cumulative session costs against this limit, resets on the
                               first of each calendar month, and flags ⚠️ when spend exceeds 80% of
                               the budget or ❌ when the budget is fully consumed.
                               Only relevant when PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y.)
```

**`KB_MODE=local` (default):** KB lives in the developer's home directory. No git sync. No encryption. Private to one machine.

**`KB_MODE=distributed`:** KB lives in a dedicated **private** git repository owned and controlled by the team (`PRX_KB_REPO`). The repo is cloned locally at `PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE`. KB access is governed by the repo's own permissions — a company Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, or GitLab instance ensures only authorised team members can read or write the knowledge base. No sensitive data is ever pushed to any public repository. If `PRX_KB_KEY` is also set, all files are AES-256-CBC encrypted before each push, adding a defense-in-depth layer. If `PRX_KB_KEY` is not set, plain Markdown is pushed directly — acceptable when the repo's access controls are sufficient.

Use `REPO_DIR` wherever the repository path is referenced.
Use `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` wherever the knowledge base path is referenced.
Use `KB_MODE` to conditionally execute sync and encryption steps.

**Pre-flight checks — run these via Bash before any step:**

```bash
# 1. REPO_DIR must be set
[ -z "$PRX_REPO_DIR" ] && echo "STOP: PRX_REPO_DIR is not set. Add it to your .env file: PRX_REPO_DIR=/absolute/path/to/your/repo" && exit 1

# 2. REPO_DIR must exist and be a git repository
[ ! -d "$PRX_REPO_DIR/.git" ] && echo "STOP: Directory '$PRX_REPO_DIR' is not a git repository (or does not exist). Check PRX_REPO_DIR in your .env file." && exit 1
```

If either check fails, stop immediately and show the error message to the developer — do not proceed to Step 0.

---

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a shared, persistent store that grows richer after every Dev and Review session. Retrieval is grep on plain Markdown — near-instant, no external dependencies. The storage and distribution model is controlled by `KB_MODE` (defined in Configuration).

**Agents get smarter with every session.** The mechanism is compounding: Session 1 discovers a business rule and writes it. Session 2 reads that rule, applies it immediately rather than re-discovering it, and writes a new architecture insight. Session 3 reads both and contributes a gotcha. After dozens of sessions the agents arrive at a new ticket already knowing the relevant business rules, the risky call sites, the recurring patterns, and the system's architecture — the same mental model a senior engineer would have built over months. This is not incidental: it is the explicit goal of every KB read and write step. **Reading and writing the KB is never optional.** An agent that skips either step makes the whole team less capable on the next ticket.

### Storage Modes

| Mode | KB location on disk | Distribution | Access control | Encryption | Agent read/write path |
|------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **local** (default) | `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` (`$HOME/.dev-skill/knowledge-base/`) | None — one machine only | Local filesystem | None | `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` directly |
| **distributed** | `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` (local clone of `PRX_KB_REPO`) | Via git push/pull to the team's private KB repository | Private repo permissions (Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, etc.) | Optional AES-256-CBC (`.md.enc` files) | `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` or `/tmp/dev-skill-kb-{PID}/` if encrypted |

**`KB_WORK_DIR`** — the path agents use for all KB reads and writes during a session:
```
KB_WORK_DIR = (KB_MODE=local)                            → {KNOWLEDGE_DIR}
            = (KB_MODE=distributed, no PRX_KB_KEY)   → {KNOWLEDGE_DIR}
            = (KB_MODE=distributed, PRX_KB_KEY set)  → /tmp/dev-skill-kb-{$$}/   ← decrypted session copy
```

Resolve `KB_WORK_DIR` in Step 0a and use it consistently for every KB read/write operation thereafter.

---

### Encryption Scheme

_(Applies only when `KB_MODE=distributed` **and** `PRX_KB_KEY` is set. Optional — plain Markdown is fine when the KB repository's access controls are sufficient.)_

**When to use:** Enable encryption when you want defense-in-depth — for example, if there is any risk the private repo could be accidentally made public, or company policy requires encrypted secrets at rest.

**Algorithm:** AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2-SHA512 key derivation (310,000 iterations, random 16-byte salt per file). Encrypted files are binary blobs — they appear as garbage when opened without the key. File extension on disk: `.md.enc`.

**Key:** `PRX_KB_KEY` environment variable — never committed to git.

**Encrypt a single file:**
```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 310000 -md sha512 \
  -in  "$KB_WORK_DIR/{file}.md" \
  -out "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/{file}.md.enc" \
  -pass env:PRX_KB_KEY
```

**Decrypt a single file:**
```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 310000 -md sha512 \
  -in  "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/{file}.md.enc" \
  -out "$KB_WORK_DIR/{file}.md" \
  -pass env:PRX_KB_KEY
```

**Batch decrypt (Step 0a — pull to session temp dir):**
```bash
KB_WORK_DIR="/tmp/dev-skill-kb-$$"
mkdir -p "$KB_WORK_DIR/tickets" "$KB_WORK_DIR/shared" "$KB_WORK_DIR/core-mental-map" "$KB_WORK_DIR/lessons-learned"
find "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR" -name "*.md.enc" | while read f; do
  rel="${f#$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/}"           # e.g. tickets/IV-3672.md.enc
  out="$KB_WORK_DIR/${rel%.enc}"       # e.g. /tmp/dev-skill-kb-$$/tickets/IV-3672.md
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$out")"
  openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 310000 -md sha512 \
    -in "$f" -out "$out" -pass env:PRX_KB_KEY 2>/dev/null || \
    echo "KB_DECRYPT_WARN: ${rel} — skipping (wrong key or corrupted)"
done
```

**Batch encrypt (Steps 13f / R9f — write back from session temp dir):**
```bash
find "$KB_WORK_DIR" -name "*.md" | while read f; do
  rel="${f#$KB_WORK_DIR/}"             # e.g. tickets/IV-3672.md
  out="$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/${rel}.enc"      # e.g. KNOWLEDGE_DIR/tickets/IV-3672.md.enc
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$out")"
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 310000 -md sha512 \
    -in "$f" -out "$out" -pass env:PRX_KB_KEY
done
# Remove stale .md.enc files whose source .md was deleted during the session
find "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR" -name "*.md.enc" | while read enc; do
  rel="${enc#$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/}"
  src="$KB_WORK_DIR/${rel%.enc}"
  [ -f "$src" ] || rm -f "$enc"
done
```

### Security Model

_(Applies to `KB_MODE=distributed`.)_

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Unauthorised access to KB content | **Private repository** — access controlled by the team's git server (Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab). Only team members with repo access can read or push. |
| Accidental public exposure of the repo | **Optional encryption** — if `PRX_KB_KEY` is set, files are AES-256-CBC encrypted; the repo can be made public and no content is readable without the key. |
| Brute-force key recovery (if encrypted) | PBKDF2-SHA512 at 310,000 iterations per file makes each guess computationally expensive. |
| Key accidentally committed (if encrypted) | `PRX_KB_KEY` is an env var only; `.md.enc` files contain no key material. |
| Plaintext KB in session temp dir (if encrypted) | Decrypted files live only in `/tmp/dev-skill-kb-{PID}/`; deleted after push (Step 13f/R9f). |

**Primary security boundary:** the private repository's access control. Encryption is additive.

**Never store `PRX_KB_KEY` in any file tracked by git.** Set it only in the developer's shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`).

---

### Directory Layout

```
{KNOWLEDGE_DIR}/                        ← KB root (path depends on KB_MODE — see Storage Modes)
├── INDEX.md    (or INDEX.md.enc)      ← combined index: Memory Palace (primary) + Master Index (fallback)
├── tickets/                            ← per-ticket files (one per analysed / reviewed ticket)
│   └── IV-XXXX.md  (or .md.enc)
├── shared/                             ← accumulated team knowledge
│   ├── business-rules.md  (or .md.enc) ← domain invariants discovered across all tickets
│   ├── architecture.md    (or .md.enc) ← class hierarchies, data flows, ownership decisions
│   ├── patterns.md        (or .md.enc) ← recurring bug/fix patterns with frequency counters
│   ├── regression-risks.md (or .md.enc)← known fragile areas requiring care on every change
│   ├── process-efficiency.md (or .md.enc) ← Bryan's session log: cost, budget, changes applied
│   └── skill-changelog.md    (or .md.enc) ← full audit trail of every Bryan SKILL.md change (before/after, commit hash, revert status)
├── core-mental-map/                    ← compressed codebase mental model (contributed by all agents)
│   ├── INDEX.md   (or INDEX.md.enc)   ← quick index: what topics exist, entry counts, last-updated
│   ├── architecture.md  (or .md.enc)  ← system layers, component boundaries, key class relationships
│   ├── business-logic.md (or .md.enc) ← core domain invariants and state machine rules
│   ├── data-flows.md    (or .md.enc)  ← key data flows, RPC contracts, write paths
│   ├── tech-stack.md    (or .md.enc)  ← technologies, frameworks, key library choices
│   └── gotchas.md       (or .md.enc)  ← non-obvious couplings, footguns, edge-case traps
└── lessons-learned/                    ← per-developer sprint retrospective entries; read by all agents
    └── {developer}.md  (or .md.enc)   ← one file per developer (name from git config or PRX_DEVELOPER_NAME)
```

In `KB_MODE=local` all files are plain `.md`. In `KB_MODE=distributed` all files on disk are `.md.enc`; the plain `.md` files exist only in `KB_WORK_DIR=/tmp/dev-skill-kb-{PID}/` during the session.

> **Note:** `PALACE.md` no longer exists as a separate file. The Memory Palace (room trigger tables) and the Master Index (flat entry list) are both sections within `INDEX.md`.

### Core Mental Map

The Core Mental Map is a **compressed, always-growing model of the codebase** — the kind of system understanding a senior engineer builds up over months on a project. Unlike `shared/`, which is ticket-driven (what went wrong and why), the Core Mental Map is **codebase-driven** (how the system works, independent of any single ticket).

Every agent contributes to it. Every session starts by reading the relevant sections. When an agent discovers something that contradicts the current map, they update the map with the freshest, most accurate information — so the whole team benefits.

#### Purpose

| `shared/*.md` | `core-mental-map/*.md` |
|---|---|
| Ticket-driven: what went wrong, root cause, fix | Codebase-driven: how the system works |
| Verbose: full context, confirmation history | Compressed: key-value facts, ≤ 3 lines per entry |
| Entries reference specific tickets | Entries reference source files and contributing sessions |
| Business rules, patterns, regression risks | Architecture, data flows, tech stack, gotchas |

#### File Descriptions

| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `architecture.md` | System layers, component hierarchy, key class relationships, ownership rules |
| `business-logic.md` | Core domain invariants, state machine rules, lifecycle constraints |
| `data-flows.md` | RPC request/response flows, DB write paths, event chains, API contracts |
| `tech-stack.md` | Technologies, frameworks, library choices, version constraints |
| `gotchas.md` | Non-obvious couplings, footguns, edge-case traps that surprised agents |

#### Entry Format (compressed)

Each entry in a Core Mental Map file is compact — no prose paragraphs. Facts only.

```markdown
## CMM-ARCH-001 — GWT Frontend → Backend API boundary
src: IV-3672 | date: 2026-03-10 | confirmed: 2 | contributors: 3
fcfrontend/ → (GWT RPC) → fcbackend/api/ → service layer → Oracle/PostgreSQL
KEY: RPC callbacks async; UI panels need explicit refresh() after response.
ref: fcfrontend/AlertCentralPanel.java:142, fcbackend/api/AlertService.java:88
```

Fields:
- **`src:`** — ticket that first contributed this entry (or "init" if inferred from a fresh code read)
- **`date:`** — date first written
- **`confirmed:`** — number of sessions that have verified this fact is still accurate
- **`contributors:`** — count of distinct agent sessions that have touched this entry
- **`KEY:`** — the single most important fact (one line, ≤ 120 chars)
- **`ref:`** — `file:line` anchors (verified against live repo before writing)
- Optional **`WARN:`** — a caveat or known exception to the rule

#### Core Mental Map INDEX.md Format

```markdown
# Core Mental Map
Updated: YYYY-MM-DD | Files: 5 | Total entries: N

| File | Entries | Updated | Summary |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| architecture.md | 3 | 2026-04-18 | System layers, GWT RPC boundary, alert chain |
| business-logic.md | 2 | 2026-04-18 | Resolve lifecycle, pending flag invariant |
| data-flows.md | 2 | 2026-04-18 | Case save path, alert resolution chain |
| tech-stack.md | 2 | 2026-04-18 | GWT 2.x, Java 8, Oracle 12c, PostgreSQL 14 |
| gotchas.md | 3 | 2026-04-18 | Boolean flag trap, orphaned alert risk |
```

#### Cross-Check & Update Protocol

At the start of every session (Step 0b) agents **read** the relevant Core Mental Map sections. During the session (Steps 5, 7, 8) agents **verify** that the map's facts match the live codebase. At the end of each session (Step 13g) agents **update** the map:

- **Confirmed fact:** increment `confirmed:` counter — no other change.
- **Corrected fact:** update `KEY:` and `ref:` with fresh values; append `[CORRECTED {date}]` tag; increment `contributors:`.
- **New fact:** append a new entry; assign next sequential ID for the file (e.g. `CMM-ARCH-004`).
- **Obsolete fact:** mark `[DELETED {date}]` but retain the entry — knowledge of why something existed is still valuable.

**Agents emit `[CMM+]` markers** (analogous to `[KB+]`) during their work to flag contributions for Step 13g. Format:

```
[CMM+ ARCH]  {one-line fact} — ref: {file:line}  [NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT / DELETE]
[CMM+ BIZ]   {one-line domain invariant} — ref: {file:line}  [NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT]
[CMM+ FLOW]  {one-line data flow description} — ref: {entry point file:line}  [NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT]
[CMM+ STACK] {one-line tech fact} — ref: {config or build file:line}  [NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT]
[CMM+ GOTCHA]{one-line footgun or non-obvious behaviour} — ref: {file:line}  [NEW / CONFIRM]
```

**Cross-check rule:** If an agent's live code read contradicts an existing Core Mental Map entry, it **must** emit a `[CMM+ ... CORRECT]` marker and update the entry in Step 13g. Do not leave stale facts in the map.

---

### Lessons Learned

The Lessons Learned folder is a **per-developer sprint retrospective record** — pitfalls, surprises, and hard-won insights that developers accumulate over time. Unlike `shared/` (ticket-driven) or `core-mental-map/` (codebase-driven), lessons-learned is **developer-driven**: each person owns their own file and writes to it after investigations or sprint reviews.

Agents read all developer files at session start (Step 0b) and surface relevant entries in the Prior Knowledge block. They also emit `[LL+]` markers during investigation to flag new pitfalls discovered during the session; these are appended to the current developer's file at Step 13h.

#### File per Developer

Each developer's lessons are stored in `lessons-learned/{developer}.md` where `{developer}` is resolved from `$PRX_DEVELOPER_NAME` (if set) or `git config user.name` (normalised to lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens). Agents write only to their own file; they read all files.

#### Entry Format

```markdown
## LL-001 — {short title}
date: 2026-04-14 | sprint: {sprint label or "—"} | ticket: {TICKET_KEY}
PITFALL: {what to avoid — specific and actionable}
KEY: {the lesson in one clear line}
ref: {file:line or "—"}
```

Fields:
- **`PITFALL:`** — the trap or mistake to avoid; written so a future agent recognises the warning
- **`KEY:`** — the corrective rule (one line, ≤ 120 chars)
- **`ref:`** — optional `file:line` anchor in the codebase that illustrates the pitfall
- **`sprint:`** — sprint label (e.g. `Sprint 42`) or `"—"` if not tracked

#### [LL+] Marker

Agents emit `[LL+]` markers during investigation (Steps 5, 7, 8) to flag lessons for Step 13h:

```
[LL+] {short title} | PITFALL: {what to avoid} | KEY: {lesson} | ref: {file:line or "—"}
```

Developers may also append entries manually to their own file at any time (e.g. after a sprint retrospective) using the entry format above.

---

### Memory Palace

The Memory Palace is the primary retrieval layer. It uses the **Method of Loci** — each part of the V1 system is a named **Room**; each knowledge entry has a **vivid trigger phrase** that makes it instantly recognisable when an agent reads a ticket. Agents walk the Palace first, before falling through to the Master Index section.

The Memory Palace lives in the **`## Memory Palace` section of `INDEX.md`** — it is not a separate file.

#### Trigger Anchors

Each knowledge entry has a **trigger** — a 5–8 word memorable phrase that lets an agent recognise relevance in under one second. Triggers live in the **`## Memory Palace` section of `INDEX.md`** and are updated when new entries are added.

#### How Agents Use the Palace

1. **Map the ticket to rooms** — from the ticket's components and labels, identify which Room(s) apply using the Room Directory table above.
2. **Scan triggers** — read only the `### Triggers` table for the matched room(s). This takes one read, ~5 lines per room.
3. **Recognise matches** — any trigger that is relevant to the current ticket is a hit. Follow its `File` link.
4. **Read the matched entry** — grep the file for the section anchor, read ±40 lines.
5. **Fall through to the Master Index** — if the Palace yields no matches, grep the `## Master Index` section of `INDEX.md` directly by component/label keyword as a fallback.

**This two-layer retrieval (Palace triggers → Master Index fallback) means agents spend ≤ 3 read operations to surface all relevant prior knowledge, even as the KB grows to hundreds of entries.**

---

### INDEX.md Format

`INDEX.md` is the single combined KB index. It has two sections:

- **`## Memory Palace`** — the primary retrieval layer. Room-based trigger tables. Agents read this first.
- **`## Master Index`** — the fallback layer. A flat list of all entries, greppable by component, label, ticket key, and trigger.

Note: A trigger may appear in multiple rooms if the knowledge spans components (e.g. BIZ-001 "resolve case → must resolve alerts" appears in both CASE ROOM and ALERT ROOM). The `Trigger` column in the Master Index matches the trigger phrases in the Memory Palace — the same entry is reachable via either layer.

### Shared Knowledge Files Format

Each shared file accumulates entries chronologically. Every entry has:
- An anchor (`{#id}`) matching its row in the Master Index section of INDEX.md
- A **trigger phrase** in the heading (used in the Memory Palace section of INDEX.md)
- A source ticket, date, and confirmation history

**`shared/business-rules.md` entry format:**
```markdown
## BIZ-001 — "resolve case → must resolve alerts" {#biz-001}
Date: 2026-03-10 | Source: IV-3672 | Rooms: CASE ROOM, ALERT ROOM
Confirmed by: IV-3801 (review, 2026-04-02)

When a case transitions to RESOLVED, all open alerts associated with that case must
also be resolved. The system achieves this via the `pendingAlertResolve` flag in
`CaseManager` — if not set before the save callback, the alert resolution chain is
silently skipped.

**Rule:** Every code path that resolves a case must set `pendingAlertResolve = true`
before calling the save service.
```

**`shared/patterns.md` entry format:**
```markdown
## PAT-001 — "flag set, never reset — boolean trap" {#pat-001}
Date: 2026-03-10 | Source: IV-3672 | Rooms: CASE ROOM | Frequency: 2
Jordan — Pattern #2 (Boolean Flag Not Reset)

Boolean flags in `CaseManager` are set on one path (resolve) but not reset on
complementary paths (cancel, error, re-open). This is Jordan's Pattern #2 recurring
in this class.

**Watch:** Any Boolean flag added or modified in `CaseManager` — verify all
complementary paths explicitly before submitting the fix.

**Recurrences:** IV-3672 (2026-03-10), IV-3810 (2026-04-05)
```

### Retrieval Rules

Follow the Memory Palace retrieval procedure in the **"How Agents Use the Palace"** section above (Palace triggers → Master Index fallback, ≤ 3 read operations). Additionally:

- **Read only matched files** — never read a full shared file; grep for the section anchor, then read ±40 lines.
- **Max 5 ticket entries** — if more than 5 ticket entries match, take the 5 most recent by date.
- **All matching shared entries** — business rules, patterns, risks matching the query are always included.
- **Never block on empty KB** — absence of prior knowledge is not an error; initialise and proceed.

### Re-Index Rules

`INDEX.md` is **derived data** — it indexes what is in `tickets/` and `shared/`. It contains no information that is not already present in those source files. Because of this, it is **always fully rebuilt from scratch** after every pull rather than merged. This eliminates all consistency problems regardless of how many developers push, in what order, or whether a push was done manually outside the skill.

**Why full rebuild, not append-only merge:**
When multiple developers push to the same KB repo, git must merge their copies of `INDEX.md`. Since it is an append-only file, git's default merge will produce conflicts whenever two developers both added rows. Resolving these conflicts manually is error-prone and defeats the purpose of automation. A full rebuild from the actual source files on disk always produces a correct, conflict-free result.

**`.gitattributes` — union merge for source files:**

The KB repo must have a `.gitattributes` file to prevent git conflicts on `shared/*.md` files (both developers may append to `business-rules.md` in the same session). Add this to the KB repo root:

```
# KB repo .gitattributes
tickets/*.md              merge=union
shared/*.md               merge=union
core-mental-map/*.md      merge=union
lessons-learned/*.md      merge=union
INDEX.md                  merge=union
```

`merge=union` tells git to keep lines from **both** sides on conflict (instead of marking `<<<<<<<` conflict markers). For append-only Markdown files this is always correct — all appended entries survive. The full rebuild then de-duplicates and normalises the result.

**Full rebuild algorithm (runs after every pull, Step 0a):**

```
1. Scan all tickets/*.md files in KB_WORK_DIR:
   For each file:
     - Read YAML frontmatter: ticket, date, type, components, labels, summary, trigger, rooms
     - Collect into an in-memory ticket list

2. Scan all shared/*.md files in KB_WORK_DIR:
   For each file, find all entries via "## {ID} — ..." headings:
     - Read: ID, trigger phrase (from heading), domain, type, date
     - Collect into an in-memory shared entry list

3. Rebuild INDEX.md from scratch:
   - Write fresh header: "Updated: {today} | Rooms: 6 | Triggers: N | Ticket entries: N | Shared entries: M"
   - Write `## Memory Palace` section:
     - For each of the 6 rooms, collect all triggers from tickets and shared entries
       whose `rooms:` field includes that room
     - Write each room's trigger table with deduplicated, sorted rows
     - For patterns: include the current Frequency value from the source entry
   - Write `## Master Index` section:
     - Write `### Ticket Entries` table — one row per ticket, sorted by date desc
     - Write `### Shared Knowledge Entries` table — one row per shared entry

4. Write INDEX.md to KB_WORK_DIR.

5. Rebuild core-mental-map/INDEX.md from scratch:
   - For each core-mental-map/*.md content file (architecture, business-logic, data-flows,
     tech-stack, gotchas), count entries ("## CMM-..." headings), read the last Updated
     date from the most recent entry's `date:` field, and extract a one-line summary.
   - Rewrite core-mental-map/INDEX.md with fresh counts, dates, and summaries.
   - Update the Total entries count in the header.

6. Rebuild shared/process-efficiency.md header and Velocity Dashboard (if PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y):
   - Scan all [S-NNN] journal entries: count sessions, changes pushed, sessions since last push
   - Compute rolling 5-session avg cost per ticket type and trend direction
   - Identify most frequent hotspot step across last 5 sessions
   - Compute change acceptance rate (applied / proposed) across last 10 sessions
   - Overwrite lines 1–separator with fresh header + Velocity Dashboard
   - Leave the append-only journal (below the ═══ separator) untouched
```

**This handles every multi-developer scenario automatically:**
- Developer joins late with a stale INDEX.md → pull + rebuild gives them the full picture (both Palace and Master Index)
- Developer manually pushes raw ticket files → other developers' rebuild picks them up
- Two developers push simultaneously → union merge keeps all rows → rebuild de-duplicates
- Developer pushes from outside the skill → rebuild on next pull reconciles everything
- Core Mental Map union-merge: two developers both append new CMM entries → union merge keeps both → rebuild recount gives correct entry totals

**process-efficiency.md — Journal Format & Rebuild (distributed mode)**

`process-efficiency.md` follows the same append-only + rebuild-on-pull pattern. The file has two zones:

1. **Auto-generated header** (lines 1–~20) — rebuilt after every pull from journal data; never edited manually
2. **Append-only journal** (everything below the `═══` separator) — raw entries only ever appended, never mutated in-place

**Journal entry formats:**

```markdown
## [S-NNN] Session Record
date: YYYY-MM-DD | developer: {name} | ticket: {KEY} | type: Bug/Enh | cost: $N | budget: $N | status: ✅/⚠️
hotspot: {Step name} ({N}%) | change: {BL-NNN or "—"} | impact: {+$N saving vs prev / "baseline"}

## [BL-NNN] Backlog Item
date: YYYY-MM-DD | area: {Step or section} | priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | seen: 1
PROBLEM: {one-line description of the inefficiency}
[SEEN+1: YYYY-MM-DD by {developer}]
[PROMOTED HIGH: YYYY-MM-DD — seen {N}×]
[CONSENSUS ❌: YYYY-MM-DD — re-queued]
[APPLIED: YYYY-MM-DD in v{X.Y.Z}]

## [BK-NNN] Blocker
date: YYYY-MM-DD | developer: {name} | description: {one-line}
[COUNT+1: YYYY-MM-DD by {developer}]
[PROMOTED HIGH: YYYY-MM-DD — seen 3×]
[RESOLVED: YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Rules that make union merge correct and lossless:**
- **Never edit any existing line** — only append new lines (status tags, count increments, observations)
- **Never rewrite the header** — it is rebuilt from journal data after pull
- **Duplicate detection** — if two developers both append `[SEEN+1]` to the same backlog item in the same session, the rebuild de-duplicates by grouping tags by date and developer

**process-efficiency.md rebuild algorithm (runs after every pull, alongside INDEX.md rebuild):**

```
1. Scan all [S-NNN] Session Records:
   - Parse date, type, cost, status — collect into session list
   - Count total sessions, sessions with change applied, sessions since last push

2. Scan all [BL-NNN] Backlog Items:
   - Parse base fields + all appended tag lines
   - Derive current priority (last [PROMOTED] tag wins)
   - Derive current status (last [APPLIED] or [CONSENSUS ❌] tag wins)
   - Count total [SEEN+1] tags to get current "seen" count

3. Scan all [BK-NNN] Blocker entries:
   - Count [COUNT+1] tags to get current count
   - Check for [RESOLVED] tag

4. Rebuild the auto-generated header from computed values:
   "Sessions tracked: N | Changes pushed: N | Sessions since last push: N | Next compaction: session N"

5. Rebuild Velocity Dashboard:
   - Sum cost of all [S-NNN] entries in the current calendar month → monthly spend
   - Compare against PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET (default 20.00): derive % used and status (✅ / ⚠️ >80% / ❌ exceeded)
   - Compute rolling avg cost across last 5 sessions and trend direction
   - Identify most frequent hotspot step across last 5 sessions
   - Compute change acceptance rate (applied / proposed across last 10 sessions)

6. Write rebuilt header + Velocity Dashboard back to the top of the file
   (overwrite lines 1–separator; leave append-only journal untouched)
```

**Multi-developer merge scenarios:**
- Two developers push in the same session → union merge appends both `[S-NNN]` blocks (different ticket keys, possibly same session number — rebuild assigns final sequential numbers); no information lost
- Two developers both increment the same backlog item → union merge keeps both `[SEEN+1]` lines; rebuild counts them correctly
- One developer applies a change, another promotes it in the same push → union merge keeps both tags; rebuild derives the correct current state from the last tag
- Stale clone catches up after many sessions → pull + union merge + rebuild gives the full picture

---

### Update Rules

1. **Always write `tickets/IV-XXXX.md`** at the end of every Dev and Review session.
2. **Append to shared files only for genuinely new knowledge** — check existing entries before appending; never duplicate.
3. **Update `INDEX.md`** — add the new ticket's trigger to the relevant room(s) in the Memory Palace section; add/update rows in the Master Index section; update header counts and date.
4. **Bump pattern frequency** — when an existing pattern recurs, increment `Frequency: N` and append the ticket to Recurrences.
5. **Confirm business rules** — when a review session validates an existing rule, add `Confirmed by:` to the entry rather than creating a duplicate.

### KB Live Annotation Protocol

**Agents do not wait until Step 13/R9 to generate knowledge.** Business rules, architecture insights, patterns, and risks are discovered continuously — during code exploration (Step 5), investigations (Step 7), fix development (Step 8), impact search (Step 9), and code review (Step R4/R5). These must be captured as they arise so nothing is lost and the KB reflects everything the session actually learned.

#### Inline `[KB+]` Marker

Any agent who discovers new business knowledge during their work **must** emit a `[KB+]` annotation inline in their output at the point of discovery. Format:

```
[KB+ BIZ]  {domain rule or invariant} — Source: {file:line or ticket}
[KB+ ARCH] {class/component insight, data flow, ownership} — {file:line}
[KB+ PAT]  Pattern #{N}: {description} — {file:line}  [NEW or BUMP]
[KB+ RISK] {area / method / class} is fragile — {reason}
```

**When to emit:**
| Agent | Emit `[KB+]` when… |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Morgan** | A business rule is stated or confirmed; a historical precedent is found in JIRA (Step 7b) |
| **Alex** | A regression-inducing commit is found; a historical coupling or breaking change is identified via git history |
| **Sam** | A domain invariant is implied by the data flow (e.g. "flag X must be set before service Y runs"); a new component interaction is discovered |
| **Jordan** | A pattern from the 20-pattern checklist is matched — `NEW` if first occurrence, `BUMP` if already in KB |
| **Riley** | A fragile area or edge case is uncovered during impact assessment; a test coverage gap is identified |

**What is worth flagging:**
- A domain rule that is implied by the code but not written anywhere (e.g. "resolving a case must also resolve its alerts")
- An architecture decision visible from the code (e.g. "AbstractXxxListener owns config; concrete subclass only wires it")
- A pattern that recurs (Jordan's 20 patterns)
- A regression risk: a method, class, or area where a change will silently break something else
- A historical coupling discovered via git blame or git log

**What is NOT worth flagging:** implementation details that are obvious from reading the code, standard Java conventions, or anything already in the Prior Knowledge block from Step 0b.

#### Session KB Collection

Step 13a/R9a collect all `[KB+]` markers from the session output (all steps) alongside the structured sources already listed. A `[KB+]` marker is treated as a candidate entry — Morgan confirms it before writing to avoid noise.

Step 13g/R9g collect all `[CMM+]` markers similarly. See the Core Mental Map section above for the full `[CMM+]` marker format and action tags (NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT / DELETE).

---

### External Knowledge Sources

The knowledge base is augmented by two live external sources that are queried during Step 0b (alongside the local KB) to provide additional context before analysis begins:

| Source | URL | What to query | When to use |
|--------|-----|--------------|-------------|
| **Confluence** | `{JIRA_URL}/wiki` (derived from your `JIRA_URL` env var) | Business requirements, functional specs, known limitations, feature documentation | Before Step 2 — search for the ticket's component or label to find any spec pages |
| **Source Repository** | `PRX_SOURCE_REPO_URL` env var (optional — set to your codebase's hosted URL) | Live source code, recent commit history, current class state | Before Step 5 — cross-check the KB's file:line references against the live main branch to confirm they are still current |

#### Confluence Query (Step 0b — External Layer 1)

Use `mcp__plugin_atlassian_atlassian__searchConfluenceUsingCql` or `mcp__plugin_atlassian_atlassian__getConfluencePage` to search for pages relevant to the ticket:

```
CQL: space = "V1" AND text ~ "{COMPONENT}" AND text ~ "{LABEL}" ORDER BY lastmodified DESC
```

For each page found:
- Extract any acceptance criteria, business rules, or known limitations that relate to the current ticket
- Note the page title and URL as a source reference
- Carry relevant findings into the **Prior Knowledge** block under a `CONFLUENCE` section
- If a page directly contradicts or extends a KB business rule, flag the discrepancy

If no matching Confluence pages are found, state: "Confluence: no pages found for these terms."

#### Bitbucket Cross-Check (Step 0b — External Layer 2)

When the KB contains `file:line` references for the matched components, verify they are still current against the live `development` branch before the investigation team acts on them:

```
URL pattern: {PRX_SOURCE_REPO_URL}/src/{main-branch}/{file_path}
(Skip this cross-check if PRX_SOURCE_REPO_URL is not set.)
```

For each KB entry that cites a specific `file:line`:
1. Confirm the class/method at that line still exists (a quick read of the relevant file range via the Bitbucket source URL, or via local `git show origin/development:{file}`)
2. If a KB entry's file:line is stale (class moved, method renamed), flag it: `⚠️ KB entry {ID} may be stale — {file:line} not found on development branch`
3. Do not update the KB entry during Step 0 — flag it and let Step 13/R9 update it with the correct location after the investigation confirms it

The Bitbucket cross-check is **best-effort**: if the repository is not accessible or the file cannot be found quickly (> 2 targeted reads), skip and proceed with `⚠️ Bitbucket cross-check skipped — verify {file:line} references manually during Step 5.`

### Git Sync Rules

_(Applies only when `KB_MODE=distributed`. Skip entirely when `KB_MODE=local` — no git operations are performed on the KB.)_

The distributed knowledge base lives in a **dedicated private git repository** (`PRX_KB_REPO`) owned and controlled by the team. It is cloned locally at `KNOWLEDGE_DIR`. Because it is a standalone repository — not a branch on the product repo — git operations are straightforward: clone once, pull at session start, push at session end.

**First-time setup (once — when creating the KB repo for the team):**
```bash
KB_CLONE="${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}"
mkdir -p "$KB_CLONE/tickets" "$KB_CLONE/shared" "$KB_CLONE/core-mental-map" "$KB_CLONE/lessons-learned"
cd "$KB_CLONE"
git init && git remote add origin "$PRX_KB_REPO"
echo "# Dev Knowledge Base" > README.md

# Create .gitattributes — union merge prevents conflicts on append-only KB files
cat > .gitattributes << 'EOF'
tickets/*.md              merge=union
shared/*.md               merge=union
core-mental-map/*.md      merge=union
lessons-learned/*.md      merge=union
INDEX.md                  merge=union
EOF

git add README.md .gitattributes
git commit -m "init: create knowledge base repo"
git push -u origin main
```

If the repo already exists and a developer is cloning for the first time:
```bash
KB_CLONE="${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}"
git clone "$PRX_KB_REPO" "$KB_CLONE"
```

**Migrating from local to distributed (solo → team):**

When a developer who has been working in `KB_MODE=local` switches to `KB_MODE=distributed`, their `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` already contains plain `.md` files with no git history. A plain `git clone` would fail on a non-empty directory. The migration must commit the existing local files into the remote KB repo.

This is handled **automatically** by the updated Pull (Step 0a) logic below — no manual steps are required. The agent detects the "directory exists, no `.git`" condition and runs the migration inline. For reference, the manual equivalent is:

> **Key requirement — read before running:** If the team KB repo uses encryption (i.e. other contributors have `PRX_KB_KEY` set), you **must** set the same `PRX_KB_KEY` passphrase in your shell profile before migrating. Migrating without it pushes plain `.md` files that are invisible to every encrypted contributor, and encrypted files they push will be invisible to you. The migration script below detects this mismatch and aborts with instructions if the remote already contains `.md.enc` files and your `PRX_KB_KEY` is unset.

```bash
KB_CLONE="${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}"
cd "$KB_CLONE"
git init
git remote add origin "$PRX_KB_REPO"
cat > .gitattributes << 'EOF'

**Migration behaviour by scenario:**

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Remote KB repo is empty (dev is first to push) | Local files committed and pushed as-is; team repo initialised with solo history. Soft warning emitted if `PRX_KB_KEY` is unset. |
| Remote KB repo already has content (joining an existing team) | Local files rebased on top of remote; union merge on `shared/*.md` keeps all entries from both sides |
| `PRX_KB_KEY` is set (encryption enabled) | Each `.md` is re-encrypted to `.md.enc` and the plain file is deleted before committing; repo never receives plaintext |
| Remote has `.md.enc` files but `PRX_KB_KEY` is **not set** | **Migration blocked.** `KB_MIGRATE_ERROR` emitted with step-by-step instructions to obtain and set the team passphrase. Local files are untouched. |
| Remote has plain `.md` files and `PRX_KB_KEY` **is set** | Migration proceeds but `KB_MIGRATE_WARN` notes the inconsistency — the team may not be using encryption; confirm with the team lead |
| Rebase conflict cannot be auto-resolved | `git rebase --skip` discards the conflicting local commit and logs `KB_MIGRATE_WARN`; run `git log ORIG_HEAD..` to recover |

After a successful migration the agent logs:
```
KB_MIGRATE: {N} local KB files migrated to distributed repo {PRX_KB_REPO}.
```
Subsequent sessions treat the directory as a normal distributed clone (the `.git` folder now exists) and follow the standard pull/push path.

**Pull (Step 0a — before session, distributed mode only):**
```bash
KB_CLONE="${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}"

if [ -d "$KB_CLONE/.git" ]; then

**Push (Steps 13f and R9f — after session, distributed mode only):**

cd "$KB_CLONE"

# Step 1 — Pull latest from remote before committing (rebase keeps history clean)
# This ensures local commits land on top of any pushes made by other developers
# since the session started, preventing non-fast-forward push failures.
git pull --rebase origin main 2>/dev/null || \
  echo "KB_PULL_WARN: rebase failed — proceeding with local-only commit."

# Step 3 — Verify remote is reachable and the branch exists
if git ls-remote --exit-code origin main >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  REMOTE_EXISTS=true
  echo "KB: remote origin/main verified."
elif git ls-remote --exit-code origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Remote repo exists but main branch not yet created (first push ever)
  REMOTE_EXISTS=false
  echo "KB: remote repo reachable — main branch does not exist yet, will create."
else
  echo "KB_PUSH_WARN: remote '${PRX_KB_REPO}' is not reachable."
  echo "             Changes committed locally. Push manually: cd ${KB_CLONE} && git push -u origin main"
  exit 0
fi

# Step 4 — Stage and commit
git add .
if git diff --cached --quiet; then
  echo "KB: no changes to push."
  exit 0
fi
git commit -m "kb({TICKET_KEY}): {type} — {one-line summary}"

# Step 5 — Push (create remote branch if this is the first push)
if [ "$REMOTE_EXISTS" = true ]; then
  git push origin main && echo "KB: pushed to ${PRX_KB_REPO}."
else
  git push --set-upstream origin main && \
    echo "KB: created and pushed origin/main at ${PRX_KB_REPO}."
fi
```

**If the push fails after the reachability check** (auth error, network drop mid-push): log `KB_PUSH_WARN: push failed — {git error}`. Changes are committed locally; run `cd $KB_CLONE && git push origin main` manually.

**Merge conflicts:** If `git pull` produces a conflict (two developers pushed simultaneously), resolve by preferring the most recent content. Prefer keeping both sets of knowledge — append rather than overwrite shared file entries where possible.

**Remote repo does not exist at all** (the URL itself is invalid or the repo was never created): `git ls-remote` will fail with a fatal error. The agent logs `KB_PUSH_WARN: KB repository '${PRX_KB_REPO}' does not exist or is inaccessible. Create the private repo first, then retry.` and skips the push without failing the session.

## Headless Mode

If `AUTO_MODE` is set to `Y`, `YES`, or `true` (case-insensitive), the skill runs in **headless mode** with no interactive prompts and no blocking gates. Default is `N` (interactive). Resolve at session start:

```bash
_am=$(echo "${AUTO_MODE:-N}" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
[ "$_am" = "Y" ] || [ "$_am" = "YES" ] || [ "$_am" = "TRUE" ] && AUTO_MODE_ON=1 || AUTO_MODE_ON=0
```

When `AUTO_MODE_ON=1`, the skill runs in **analysis-only mode** with no interactive prompts and no side effects:

| Gate | Interactive behaviour | Headless default |
|------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Step 0 — KB initialisation | Create directory if needed, present Prior Knowledge block | Create directory if needed; present Prior Knowledge block as normal — no interactive element |
| Step 13 — KB update failure | Warn developer if a write fails | Log `KB_WRITE_WARN: {reason}` and continue — do not block session completion |
| Step R0 — KB initialisation (Review mode) | Same as Step 0 | Same as Step 0 |
| Step R9 — KB update failure (Review mode) | Same as Step 13 | Same as Step 13 |
| Step 1 — MCP failure | Stop and wait for developer | Print `HEADLESS_ERROR: {reason}` and exit immediately |
| Step 4a — Base branch unconfirmed | Ask developer which branch to use | Default to `development`; note the fallback in output |
| Step 4c — Branch creation | Run `git checkout -b …` | **Skip** — report the branch name that would be created, run no git commands |
| Step 5 — Low file-map confidence | Stop and ask developer | Proceed with `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE — manual review required` |
| Step 6e — Low replication confidence | Stop and ask developer | Proceed with `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE — assumptions noted` |
| Step 7b — Morgan briefing *(Bug only)* | Morgan opens session and briefs team | Morgan briefing runs as normal; no developer input required |
| Step 7d — Mid-point check-in *(Bug only)* | Engineers and Riley report progress to Morgan | All four submit status; Morgan responds automatically |
| Step 7f — Riley's questions + Morgan cross-examination *(Bug only)* | Riley poses open question; Morgan cross-examines | All questions and responses generated automatically; no developer input required |
| Step 7g — Team debate *(Bug only)* | Open floor for one challenge round | Debate runs automatically; if no challenges, state "No challenges" and proceed |
| Step 7h — Morgan verdict *(Bug only)* | Morgan scores and declares adopted root cause | Verdict runs automatically; proceed with highest-scoring hypothesis |
| Step 8c — Morgan fix review | Morgan vets the proposed fix | Review runs automatically; if REWORK REQUIRED, revise once and re-run; if still failing, proceed with `⚠️ UNRESOLVED — developer review required` |
| Step 8d — Apply fix prompt | Ask yes / no / partial | **Default to no** — propose the fix only; do not call Edit or modify any files |
| Step 12e — Email report | Send report to `PRX_EMAIL_TO` if set | **Always runs** — email is sent automatically whenever `PRX_EMAIL_TO` is configured; no interactive element |

In headless mode, Steps 1–10 run and produce full output with all interactive gates bypassed using safe defaults. Steps 11 and 12 (session stats + PDF report) run as normal so the PDF is saved to disk. Email (Step 12e) fires automatically if `PRX_EMAIL_TO` is set.

## Mode Selection

This skill operates in three modes. Detect the mode from the invocation:

| Mode | Trigger phrases | What runs |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Dev Mode** | `IV-XXXX`, `start dev on IV-XXXX`, `pick up IV-XXXX`, `/dev IV-XXXX` | **Step 0** (KB query) → Steps 1–12 (full dev workflow → proposed fix → PDF) → **Step 13** (KB update) |
| **PR Review Mode** | `review IV-XXXX`, `PR review IV-XXXX`, `code review IV-XXXX`, `/dev review IV-XXXX` | **Step R0** (KB query) → Steps R1–R8 (code diff review → PDF) → **Step R9** (KB update) |
| **Estimate Mode** | `estimate IV-XXXX`, `size IV-XXXX`, `point IV-XXXX`, `/dev estimate IV-XXXX` | **Step E0** (KB query) → Steps E1–E7 (planning poker → consensus → Jira update → KB update) |

**→ Check for trigger words in order: `estimate`/`size`/`point` → Estimate Mode. `review` → PR Review Mode. Otherwise → Dev Mode.**

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when the developer provides:
- A Jira ticket URL: `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-1234`
- A Jira ticket key: `PROJ-1234`
- A phrase like `/prx:dev PROJ-1234` or `/dev PROJ-1234` or "start dev on PROJ-1234" or "pick up PROJ-1234"
- A phrase like `review PROJ-1234` or `PR review PROJ-1234` or `/dev review PROJ-1234` for code review
- A phrase like `estimate PROJ-1234` or `size PROJ-1234` or `/dev estimate PROJ-1234` for effort estimation

Do NOT invoke for general code questions unrelated to a Jira ticket.

## Workflow Steps

Execute all steps **in order**. Do not skip steps. Present output to the developer as you complete each one.

**Output verbosity** — resolve once at session start:
```bash
PRX_REPORT_VERBOSITY="${PRX_REPORT_VERBOSITY:-full}"
```
Apply throughout:
- `full` — every structured block, all panel dialogue, verbatim debate rounds (default)
- `compact` — all structured blocks intact (Root Cause Statement, Enhancement Statement, Fix, Morgan's verdicts, Riley's assessment); panel narrative (mid-point check-ins, debate, Morgan's briefing prose) condensed to bullet summaries. **The PDF always receives full content regardless of this setting.**
- `minimal` — structured blocks only; no panel narrative, no debate round, no check-in dialogue

### Step 0 — Knowledge Base: Sync, Initialise & Query

This step runs in two phases. **Phase A** (sync + initialise) runs before Step 1. **Phase B** (query) runs after Step 1 once ticket metadata is available.

#### 0a. Sync & Initialise

##### If `KB_MODE=local` (default):

**Step 1 — Initialise directories (no git sync):**
```bash
mkdir -p "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/tickets" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/shared" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/core-mental-map" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/lessons-learned"
```
Set `KB_WORK_DIR="$KNOWLEDGE_DIR"`. No git operations.

**Step 2 — Create skeleton files if this is a first run:** _(see common steps below)_

**Step 3 — Report status:** _(see common steps below)_

---

##### If `KB_MODE=distributed`:

**Step 1 — Verify `PRX_KB_REPO` is set:**
```bash
if [ -z "$PRX_KB_REPO" ]; then
  echo "KB_ERROR: PRX_KB_REPO is not set."
  echo "         Set it to your team's private KB repository URL in your shell profile."
  echo "         Continuing without knowledge base."
fi
```
If not set, skip all remaining distributed steps and proceed without prior knowledge. Warn the developer prominently.

**Step 2 — Pull from the private KB repository:**

Use the pull command from the **Git Sync Rules** section above. If the local clone does not exist, clone the repo first.

```bash
KB_CLONE="${PRX_KB_LOCAL_CLONE:-$HOME/.dev-skill/kb}"
if [ -d "$KB_CLONE/.git" ]; then
  cd "$KB_CLONE" && git pull origin main && \
    echo "KB: pulled latest from ${PRX_KB_REPO}."
else
  git clone "$PRX_KB_REPO" "$KB_CLONE" && \
    echo "KB: cloned ${PRX_KB_REPO} → ${KB_CLONE}."
  mkdir -p "$KB_CLONE/tickets" "$KB_CLONE/shared" "$KB_CLONE/core-mental-map" "$KB_CLONE/lessons-learned"
fi
```

**Step 3 — Set `KB_WORK_DIR`:**

- If `PRX_KB_KEY` is **not set**: `KB_WORK_DIR="$KNOWLEDGE_DIR"` — operate directly on the local clone (plain Markdown).
- If `PRX_KB_KEY` **is set** (encryption enabled): clean up any prior session temp dirs, then decrypt:

```bash
# Clean prior temp dirs
rm -rf /tmp/dev-skill-kb-[0-9]* 2>/dev/null

# Decrypt to session temp dir
KB_WORK_DIR="/tmp/dev-skill-kb-$$"
mkdir -p "$KB_WORK_DIR/tickets" "$KB_WORK_DIR/shared" "$KB_WORK_DIR/core-mental-map" "$KB_WORK_DIR/lessons-learned"
find "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR" -name "*.md.enc" | while read f; do
  rel="${f#$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/}"
  out="$KB_WORK_DIR/${rel%.enc}"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$out")"
  openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 310000 -md sha512 \
    -in "$f" -out "$out" -pass env:PRX_KB_KEY 2>/dev/null || \
    echo "KB_DECRYPT_WARN: ${rel} — skipping (wrong key or corrupted)"
done
enc_count=$(find "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR" -name "*.md.enc" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "KB: decrypted ${enc_count} encrypted files → ${KB_WORK_DIR}/"
```

**Step 4 — Create skeleton files if this is a first run:** _(see common steps below)_

**Step 5 — Report status:** _(see common steps below)_

---

##### Common steps (both modes — operate on `KB_WORK_DIR`):

**Create skeleton files if this is a first run:**

If `INDEX.md` does not exist, create:
```markdown

### Shared Knowledge Entries

|-------|--------|------|------|---------|------|---------|
```

If any `shared/*.md` file does not exist, create it with a title-only header.

If `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` does not exist, create it:
```markdown
# Core Mental Map
Updated: {today} | Files: 5 | Total entries: 0

| File | Entries | Updated | Summary |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| architecture.md | 0 | {today} | — |
| business-logic.md | 0 | {today} | — |
| data-flows.md | 0 | {today} | — |
| tech-stack.md | 0 | {today} | — |
| gotchas.md | 0 | {today} | — |
```

If any `core-mental-map/*.md` content file does not exist, create it with a title-only header (e.g. `# Architecture`). The files will be populated as agents contribute entries during sessions.

The `lessons-learned/` directory requires no skeleton files — developer files are created on first write (Step 13h). No action needed on init if the directory is empty.

If `shared/process-efficiency.md` does not exist, create it:
```markdown
# Process Efficiency Log
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — rebuilt after every pull. Never edit this header manually. -->
Sessions tracked: 0 | Changes pushed: 0 | Sessions since last push: 0 | Next compaction: session {PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL}

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED VELOCITY DASHBOARD — rebuilt after every pull -->
## Velocity Dashboard
| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Monthly spend (current month) | $— of $— | — |
| Monthly budget status | — | — |
| Avg cost — last 5 sessions | $— | — |
| Token hotspot | — | — |
| Change acceptance rate | — | — |

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     APPEND-ONLY JOURNAL — never edit existing lines; only append new
     ones. Bryan rebuilds the header and dashboard from these entries
     after every pull, the same way INDEX.md is rebuilt.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
```

If `shared/skill-changelog.md` does not exist, create it:
```markdown
# SKILL.md Change Log
<!-- append-only — Bryan appends one [SC-NNN] block per approved and pushed change -->
<!-- Cross-reference: each entry links to the git commit so any change can be reverted with `git revert <commit>` -->
```

> **Merge safety:** `skill-changelog.md` is append-only — entries are never edited, only new blocks and status tags appended. `shared/*.md merge=union` in `.gitattributes` ensures lossless merges from concurrent pushes.

> **Merge safety:** `process-efficiency.md` uses an **append-only journal** below the auto-generated header. All raw data (sessions, backlog items, blockers) is expressed as new appended lines, never edits to existing lines. The header and Velocity Dashboard are rebuilt from the journal after every pull — exactly as `INDEX.md` is rebuilt. This makes `merge=union` correct and lossless for all concurrent pushes.

**Re-index after pull (distributed mode) or on every init (local mode):**

After a pull, other developers may have pushed ticket or shared files that are not yet referenced in the local INDEX.md. Scan the actual files on disk and reconcile any missing entries — do **not** rebuild from scratch; only add what is absent.

```bash
# Step 1 — Find ticket files not yet in INDEX.md
for f in "$KB_WORK_DIR"/tickets/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  key=$(basename "$f" .md)                          # e.g. IV-3801
  grep -q "$key" "$KB_WORK_DIR/INDEX.md" && continue  # already indexed

  # Read frontmatter fields from the file
  trigger=$(grep "^trigger:" "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^trigger: *//')
  rooms=$(grep   "^rooms:"   "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^rooms: *//')
  type=$(grep    "^type:"    "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^type: *//')
  date=$(grep    "^date:"    "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^date: *//')
  components=$(grep "^components:" "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^components: *//')
  labels=$(grep  "^labels:"  "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^labels: *//')
  summary=$(grep "^summary:" "$f" | head -1 | sed 's/^summary: *//')

  # Add row to Master Index section of INDEX.md
  echo "| $key | $date | $type | $components | $labels | $summary | tickets/${key}.md |" \
    >> "$KB_WORK_DIR/INDEX.md"
  echo "KB_REINDEX: added $key to INDEX.md (Master Index)"

  # Add trigger to Memory Palace section of INDEX.md for each room listed in frontmatter
  echo "KB_REINDEX: trigger '${trigger}' for rooms '${rooms}' — add to INDEX.md (Memory Palace)"
done

# Step 2 — Find shared entries not yet in INDEX.md
for f in "$KB_WORK_DIR"/shared/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  fname=$(basename "$f")
  # Scan for ## ENTRY-NNN headings
  grep -oE "^## [A-Z]+-[0-9]+" "$f" | while read heading; do
    id="${heading## }"                               # e.g. BIZ-001
    grep -q "$id" "$KB_WORK_DIR/INDEX.md" && continue
    trigger=$(grep -A1 "^## ${id}" "$f" | tail -1 | grep -oP '"[^"]+"' | head -1)
    echo "KB_REINDEX: shared entry $id not in INDEX.md — add row to Master Index for shared/$fname"
  done
done
```

After the re-index scan, update the `Updated:` date and all counts in the INDEX.md header to reflect the current state.

> **Why re-index on every pull?** INDEX.md is derived data — it indexes what is in the `tickets/` and `shared/` directories. When a developer pushes their KB files, git merges the raw content files, but INDEX.md may reflect a different state. The re-index step makes the local derived file consistent with whatever files are actually present on disk after the pull, without overwriting anyone's entries.

**Report status:**

```
KB: {KNOWLEDGE_DIR}
    Ticket entries : {N}  ({M} re-indexed from disk after pull)
    Shared entries : {P}  ({Q} re-indexed from disk after pull)
    Palace triggers: {R}
    Last updated   : {date from INDEX.md header or "new"}
    Index file     : INDEX.md (Memory Palace + Master Index)
```

**Lightweight KB integrity sweep** — immediately after the status block above, run a quick background pass over `shared/*.md` to flag entries with file:line references that are obviously stale (file no longer exists). Budget: ≤ 5 targeted `ls` or `grep` checks — do not read whole files.

```bash
# For each file:line reference found in shared KB and Core Mental Map files, check the file still exists:
grep -rh "ref:" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/shared/" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/core-mental-map/" 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -oP '[a-zA-Z/._-]+\.(java|py|js|ts|sql|xml)' | sort -u | while read f; do
  [ ! -f "$REPO_DIR/$f" ] && echo "STALE_REF: $f"
done
```

Any `STALE_REF` lines are held in memory for the session. These entries will be auto-healed in Step 13c (shared files) and Step 13g (Core Mental Map) after the session analysis is complete. Do not interrupt Step 0 for this — note `{N} stale file references flagged for auto-heal` and continue.

#### 0b. Query (runs after Step 1 — ticket metadata available)

Once Step 1 has returned the ticket's **components** and **labels**, query in two layers:

**Layer 1 — Memory Palace (primary, fast path):**

Execute the Memory Palace retrieval procedure (see **"How Agents Use the Palace"** in the KB Architecture section): map ticket components/labels to rooms → scan triggers → read matched entries. Always ≤ 3 read operations.

**Layer 2 — Master Index fallback (if Palace yields no matches):**

```bash
grep -i "{COMPONENT}" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/INDEX.md"
grep -i "{LABEL}"     "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/INDEX.md"
grep -i "{TICKET_KEY}" "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR/INDEX.md"
```

Read the 5 most recent matching ticket entries and all matching shared entries.

**Layer 3 — Core Mental Map (always runs, regardless of Palace/Master Index hits):**

Read `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` to see available topics and entry counts. Then:

1. For each `core-mental-map/*.md` content file whose summary in `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` is relevant to the current ticket's components or topic, read the full file. (Files are small — compressed format; full reads are acceptable.)
2. Carry all relevant CMM entries into the Prior Knowledge block under `CORE MENTAL MAP`.
3. Increment the `confirmed:` counter for each CMM entry read — write the counter update to the file immediately (in-place sed or targeted edit) so other agents see fresh confirmation counts. If the file has not changed since last session, skip the counter update to avoid unnecessary writes.

If `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` does not exist or all files show `0` entries: state `Core Mental Map: empty — will populate in Step 13g.`

**Layer 4 — Lessons Learned (always runs):**

Read all `lessons-learned/*.md` files. For each entry whose `PITFALL:` or `KEY:` text overlaps with the current ticket's components, labels, or affected area, carry it into the Prior Knowledge block under `LESSONS LEARNED`. Show the author and date so the agent knows the source. If the directory is empty or no files exist: state `Lessons Learned: none recorded yet.`

**Present the Prior Knowledge block before Step 2:**

```

If no local KB entries and no Confluence results: `Prior knowledge: none found — starting fresh.`
If Confluence is unreachable: omit the CONFLUENCE section and note `Confluence: unavailable.`
If Bitbucket cross-check skipped: note `Bitbucket: skipped — verify file:line refs in Step 5.`

**The Prior Knowledge block is mandatory, not advisory.** Agents must actively use it:

- **Step 2:** State explicitly whether KB entries confirm, extend, or contradict the ticket's problem description. If a business rule applies, name it.
- **Step 5:** Check Core Mental Map `ref:` entries before grepping the codebase — known `file:line` anchors must be tried first. If a CMM entry contradicts live code, flag it for Step 13g correction.
- **Step 7:** Morgan must open the investigation by explicitly stating which KB history items (if any) inform the root cause direction. "KB prior knowledge not applicable" is a valid statement — but silence is not.
- **Step 8:** If a KB pattern or proven fix exists for this type of problem, build on it. State why you are deviating if you choose a different approach.
- **Step 13g:** Any `[CMM+]` markers emitted during Steps 5/7/8/9 are written to the Core Mental Map. Every session must produce at minimum one `[CMM+ ... CONFIRM]` for each CMM entry read in Step 0b — confirming facts against live code is how the map stays accurate.

**Compounding rule:** Each session must leave the KB and Core Mental Map in a more accurate or more complete state than it found them. A session that writes nothing — not even a confirmation — breaks the compounding chain.

### Step 1 — Read the Jira Ticket

Use `mcp__jira__get_issue` with the ticket key extracted from the input. Request only the fields needed: `summary`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `status`, `assignee`, `reporter`, `labels`, `components`, `fixVersions`, `versions`, `description`, `comment`, `attachment`. Do not fetch sprint metadata, change logs, epic links, or watcher lists.

**If the MCP call fails** (authentication error, ticket not found, MCP server not running):

Retry with exponential backoff before giving up — transient network issues should not abort the session:

```
Attempt 1 — immediate
Attempt 2 — wait 30 s
Attempt 3 — wait 30 s
```

If all three attempts fail:
- State the exact error returned by the last attempt
- In **interactive mode**: stop and instruct the developer to verify: (1) the Atlassian MCP is running, (2) the API token is valid, (3) the ticket key is correct. Do not proceed until the developer confirms the issue is resolved.
- In **headless mode** (`AUTO_MODE_ON=1`): print `HEADLESS_ERROR: MCP unavailable after 3 attempts — {error}` and exit immediately.

Display:
- **Summary** (ticket title)
- **Type** (Story / Bug / Support / Task)
- **Priority**
- **Status**
- **Assignee** and **Reporter**
- **Labels** and **Components**
- **Fix Version** (target release)
- **Full description** — extract all text from the ADF body content

---

### Step 2 — Understand the Problem

Analyse the description and produce a concise internal summary:

- **What is the problem / enhancement?** (1–2 sentences)
- **Who is affected?** (which user role, client, or system)
- **What is the expected behaviour?**
- **What is the current (broken/missing) behaviour?**
- **Acceptance criteria** — list each criterion clearly

If the ticket type is a **Bug**, explicitly state:
> "This is a defect — the system is doing X but should be doing Y."

If the ticket type is a **Story/Enhancement**, explicitly state:
> "This is an enhancement — the system currently lacks X; we need to add Y."

#### Linked & Associated Tickets

Fetch all issue links from the ticket (e.g. "is blocked by", "blocks", "relates to", "is cloned from", "duplicates", "is caused by", parent/child epic links, sub-task relationships).

**Lazy fetch — two-phase approach to avoid unnecessary full fetches:**

Phase 1 — fetch summary + status only for all linked tickets. Rate each for relevance:
- **High relevance**: same component as primary ticket; or `Closed/Resolved` with a root cause documented; or link type is `is caused by` / `is cloned from` / `duplicates`
- **Low relevance**: `relates to` with a different component; `blocks` / `is blocked by` with no shared component; `Open` with no description

Fetch full details (Phase 2) **only for High-relevance tickets**. For Low-relevance tickets, record the one-line summary and status only — do not fetch full description or attachments.

State: `Linked tickets: {N} found — {M} High-relevance (full fetch), {P} Low-relevance (summary only)`

For each **High-relevance** linked ticket:
1. Retrieve the full ticket details (summary, description, status, type, resolution, attachments).
2. Extract any context that enriches the current analysis:
   - Prior investigations or findings already documented
   - Acceptance criteria or scope changes that affect this ticket
   - Root cause or fix details from a related bug (especially "is caused by" / "is cloned from" links)
   - Design decisions or constraints described in parent epics or stories
   - Known workarounds or regression notes from "relates to" tickets
3. **Discover associated PRs** — check the ticket's remote issue links and development panel for any linked pull requests. For each PR found:
   - Fetch the PR title, status (open/merged/declined), source branch, and target branch
   - Retrieve the full diff / file changes from the PR
   - Analyse the code changes: what was modified, why (based on PR description and commit messages), and whether the change is relevant to the current ticket's problem or fix
   - If the PR is merged, note which branch it landed on and when
   - Summarise: `PR #N — "[title]" (status) — one-sentence relevance and key code change`
4. Summarise each linked ticket in one line: `[KEY] (type, status) — one-sentence relevance to this ticket`

Apply the same attachment analysis rules (file type handling) to qualifying attachments on linked tickets.

If the linked ticket provides no additional context beyond what the primary ticket already contains, state: "No additional context from linked ticket [KEY]."

If there are no linked tickets, state: "No linked tickets found."

Carry all relevant findings from linked tickets forward into the **Prior Investigation Summary** in Step 3.

#### Diagnostic Artefact Analysis

**Attachment triage pass** — before downloading or deeply analysing any attachment, classify each one in one line (name, type, size, direct relevance to the problem statement). Only deep-analyse attachments rated **directly relevant**:

| Relevance | Criteria | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Direct** | Screenshot of the reported error; log containing the exception; config file for the failing component | Deep-analyse |
| **Indirect** | Generic UI screenshot unrelated to the error path; log from a different service; diagram of an unaffected flow | Note filename and type only — state "skipped (indirect)" |

State: `Attachments: {N} total — {M} directly relevant (deep-analyse), {P} indirect (noted only)`

Download and analyse all qualifying attachments from the ticket.

Resolve the size limit once before processing attachments:
```
ATTACH_MAX_MB = ${PRX_ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB:-0}   ← 0 means no limit
```

Apply these rules:

| Attachment type | Size limit | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Images / screenshots | **none** — always read regardless of `PRX_ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB` | Describe visually — UI state, error messages, highlighted fields |
| Log files (`.log`, `.txt`) | `ATTACH_MAX_MB` (0 = no limit) | Scan for stack traces, exceptions, and error patterns |
| Thread dumps (`.tdump`, `.txt` with thread stacks) | `ATTACH_MAX_MB` (0 = no limit) | Full analysis — see below |
| Memory / heap dumps (`.hprof`, `.heap`) | `ATTACH_MAX_MB` (0 = no limit) | Full analysis — see below |
| XML / config files | `ATTACH_MAX_MB` (0 = no limit) | Check for relevant config values, malformed entries |
| draw.io diagrams (`.drawio`, `.xml`) | `ATTACH_MAX_MB` (0 = no limit) | Describe the flow depicted |
| Binary files, archives (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.war`, `.class`) | any | Skip — state "skipped (binary/archive)" |
| Non-image file exceeding `ATTACH_MAX_MB` | — | Skip — state "skipped (exceeds ${ATTACH_MAX_MB} MB limit)" |

For each attachment analysed, state its filename, type, size, and a one-line summary of what was found before the detailed analysis below.

---

**Screenshots / Images:**
- Describe the UI state visible — screen name, error banners, field values, highlighted rows
- Note any error codes, HTTP status, or modal messages visible in the screenshot

**Thread Dumps** (`.tdump`, `.txt`, `.log` files containing thread stack traces):
- Identify threads in `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, or `TIMED_WAITING` state
- Look for deadlock indicators (threads waiting on locks held by each other)
- Extract the top stack frames from the relevant thread — note the class and method at the point of contention
- Summarise: "Thread `X` is blocked at `ClassName.method():line` waiting for lock held by thread `Y`"

**Memory Dumps / Heap Dumps** (`.hprof`, `.heap`, OOM log excerpts):
- Identify the object type dominating heap usage
- Note the `OutOfMemoryError` message and which heap space was exhausted (heap, metaspace, stack)
- Extract any GC log patterns if present (frequent full GCs, long pause times)
- Summarise: "Heap exhausted by `N` instances of `ClassName` — likely a retention/leak in `FlowX`"

**Application / Server Logs** (`.log`, stack trace excerpts in description or attachments):
- Extract the full exception chain (root cause first)
- Note the first application frame in the stack trace (below any framework frames)
- Note timestamps and whether the error is intermittent or consistent
- Summarise: "`NullPointerException` at `ClassName.method():line` — triggered when `condition`"

**XML / Config Files:**
- Identify the config type (worker config, routing rule, datasource, etc.)
- Note any values that appear incorrect, missing, or relevant to the reported issue

If no attachments are present, state: "No attachments found — proceeding from description only."
If attachments are present but none are qualifying types, state: "Attachments present but all skipped (binary/archive or exceeds configured size limit)."

Carry all findings forward into the **Prior Investigation Summary** in Step 3 and the **Root Cause Analysis** in Step 7.

#### Issue Diagram (optional)

For issues involving a **non-obvious data flow or multi-step component interaction** (e.g. a race condition, a cross-layer call chain, a plugin → backend → DB path), generate a draw.io XML diagram and save it to `/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-diagram.drawio`.

The diagram should show:
- The **happy path** (what should happen) as a green flow
- The **broken path** (what actually happens) as a red flow
- Key method calls and data values annotated at each transition point

State: `Diagram saved to /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-diagram.drawio`

**Skip this diagram automatically for** trivial single-file bugs, simple null checks, or straightforward field additions where the flow is self-evident from the code. State: `Diagram skipped — single-file change, flow is self-evident.`

---

### Step 3 — Read Comments for Additional Context

Use `mcp__jira__get_comments` to fetch all comments on the ticket.

Summarise:
- Any clarifications from the reporter or PO
- Decisions made in comments that affect implementation
- Known constraints, edge cases, or related tickets mentioned
- Any prior investigation or partial fixes already done

If there are no comments, state: "No comments — proceed from description only."

#### Prior Investigation Carry-Forward

If any comments contain previous investigation work (root cause findings, code traces, attempted fixes, identified files, test results, or partial solutions), extract and explicitly carry these forward as **known context** for Steps 5, 7, and 8. Do not re-investigate what has already been established.

Produce a **Prior Investigation Summary** block if applicable:

```
Prior Investigation Summary:
- Root cause identified: [what was found]
- Files already identified: [list]
- Attempted fixes: [what was tried and outcome]
- Confirmed working / not working: [what was already validated]
- Remaining unknowns: [what is still unresolved]
```

This summary must be referenced in Step 7 (Root Cause Analysis) and Step 8 (Propose the Fix) — build the solution on top of what is already known rather than starting from scratch.

---

### Step 4 — Create the Development Branch

#### 4a. Determine the Base Branch

Use the following priority order to determine the base branch:

1. **Fix Versions is set** → derive the version string (e.g. `1.24.292` from `1.24.292.p1`), then check whether a release feature branch exists:
   ```bash
   git branch --list "Feature/Release_{VERSION}" && git branch -r | grep "Feature/Release_{VERSION}"
   ```
   - If `Feature/Release_{VERSION}` exists (locally or remotely) → fork from it, so the fix builds on top of any release-level work already in progress
   - If not found → fork from the plain version branch (e.g. `1.24.292`)
2. **Fix Versions is empty, Affected Versions is set** → fork from the plain version branch (e.g. `1.24.292`)
3. **Both are empty** → fork from `development`

| Version value          | Feature/Release branch found? | Base branch to use              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Not set / empty        | —                            | `development`                   |
| e.g. `1.24.292.p1`    | Yes (`Feature/Release_1.24.292`) | `Feature/Release_1.24.292`  |
| e.g. `1.24.292.p1`    | No                           | `1.24.292`                      |
| e.g. `1.24.292`        | Yes                          | `Feature/Release_1.24.292`      |
| e.g. `1.24.292`        | No                           | `1.24.292`                      |

Rule: Strip any suffix after the third version segment (e.g. `.p1`, `.hotfix`) — always use the base `major.minor.patch` format as the version string.

**Base branch confirmation gate:** Before running any `git checkout` or `git checkout -b` command, verify the chosen base branch exists either locally or on the remote:
```bash
git branch --list {BASE_BRANCH}
git branch -r | grep "origin/{BASE_BRANCH}"
```
If it cannot be confirmed in either location, **stop and ask the developer** which branch to use rather than silently forking from a stale or incorrect HEAD.

State clearly which base branch will be used and why before running any git command.

#### 4b. Determine the Feature Branch Name

Use this format:
```
Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Ticket_Summary_Title_Case_Underscored}
```

Rules:
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Remove special characters (except underscores)
- Title-case each word
- Keep it under 80 characters total
- Prefix always `Feature/`

Example: `IV-3672` + "Resolving Cases should Resolve Alerts"
→ `Feature/IV-3672_Resolving_Cases_Should_Resolve_Alerts`

#### 4c. Create the Branch

Run the following commands **in the repository working directory** (`{REPO_DIR}/`):

First, check if the base branch exists locally:

```bash
git branch --list {BASE_BRANCH}
```

- **If the branch exists locally** — check it out directly, no remote sync:
  ```bash
  git checkout {BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Formatted_Title}
  ```

- **If the branch does NOT exist locally** — fetch it from remote first, then fork:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin {BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b {BASE_BRANCH} origin/{BASE_BRANCH}
  git checkout -b Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Formatted_Title}
  ```

Confirm the branch was created and is checked out.

---

### Step 5 — Locate Affected Code

Based on the ticket description, comments, and labels, search the codebase at `{REPO_DIR}/` to identify:

1. **Primary files likely affected** — use Grep/Glob to locate relevant classes, methods, or config
2. **Entry point** — where does the flow start? (API endpoint, UI event handler, worker, scheduled job)
3. **Data flow** — trace the relevant path through the layers (Frontend → API → DataSource → DB, or Worker → Plugin → etc.)
4. **Related files** — any model, DTO, or DB script changes that will likely be needed
5. **Class hierarchy** *(mandatory for enhancement tickets adding new fields or methods)* — identify the full inheritance chain of the target class:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "extends {TargetClass}\|class {TargetClass} extends" --include="*.java" {REPO_DIR}/
   ```
   - Confirm the abstract base class (if any) and grep for all sibling subclasses
   - Ask: does the new infrastructure (fields, getters/setters, utility methods) belong in the concrete class, or in the abstract base so future subclasses inherit it automatically?
   - **Rule:** If the abstract base already owns similar state for other listeners/workers in the same family, the new state belongs there too. Keep only the concrete-class-specific config wiring (`getConfig()` items, `setAttribute()` cases) in the concrete class.
   - Add the abstract base class to the file map with role "Abstract base — owns shared infrastructure"

#### Grep-First, Read-Second Rule (mandatory)

Never read an entire source file speculatively. Always follow this sequence:

1. `Grep` for the relevant class name, method name, or keyword → get the exact file path and line number
2. `Read` only the relevant line range (the method ± ~20 lines of surrounding context)
3. Only read the full file if the method spans many lines or the grep result is ambiguous

Reading a 40-line method costs ~60 tokens. Reading a 2,000-line Java file costs ~3,000 tokens. Apply this discipline to every file in this step and in Step 8.

Use the ticket **Labels** and **Components** as hints:
- `CaseManager` → `fcfrontend/.../view/CaseManager.java`
- `AlertCentral` → `fcfrontend/.../view/AlertCentral.java` and backend alert APIs
- `FRAMS` → case/alert related backend in `fcbackend/src/main/java/com/fc/api/`
- `Plugin`/`Worker` → `fcplugin/src/main/java/com/fc/plugin/`
- DB changes → `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/`

Present a **file map** — list each file with its role, the specific method or line range identified, and recent git history for primary files:

| File | Role | Key Location | Recent Git History |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Primary fix target | `resolveCase():2272` | Last modified: 3 days ago by Javed — "IV-3641 fix alert sync" |

To populate the Recent Git History column, run:
```bash
git log --oneline -3 -- {file_path}
```

#### Confidence Gate

After building the file map, assess your certainty:

- **High** — the relevant class, method, and line number are confirmed via grep → proceed automatically
- **Medium** — file identified but exact method is ambiguous; note the assumption and proceed, flagging it clearly
- **Low** — cannot locate the relevant code with reasonable certainty → **stop and ask the developer** for guidance before continuing to Step 6

State the confidence level explicitly: `File map confidence: High — proceeding.`

**Opportunistic KB stale validation** — for each file now confirmed in the file map, cross-check any KB entries (from the Step 0b Prior Knowledge block) that referenced that file. Since you are already reading these files, this costs zero extra ops:
- If a KB entry's `file:line` still matches → mark `VALID` (no action needed)
- If the line content has shifted → calculate new line, flag `RELOCATED` for Step 13c auto-heal
- If the symbol is gone from the file → flag `STALE` for Step 13c to mark `[DELETED]`

Emit inline: `KB cross-check: {N} refs validated, {M} flagged for auto-heal` and continue — do not pause the step.

#### KB Annotations — Step 5

While building the file map, emit `[KB+]` markers for any architecture or business knowledge discovered:
- `[KB+ ARCH]` — whenever a class hierarchy, ownership rule, or layer interaction is confirmed (e.g. "AbstractXxxListener owns shared config; concrete subclasses only wire `getConfig()`")
- `[KB+ BIZ]` — whenever the code implies a domain invariant not stated in the ticket (e.g. "saving a case also triggers alert resolution via the `pendingAlertResolve` flag")
- `[KB+ RISK]` — whenever a widely-coupled class or method is identified in the file map (e.g. "resolveCase() is called from 4 different screens")

These annotations are collected in Step 13a alongside the Panel's `[KB+]` markers.

---

### Step 6 — Replicate the Issue

Based on the ticket description, comments, and located code, produce clear step-by-step reproduction instructions that any developer on the team can follow to observe the problem firsthand before attempting a fix.

#### 6a. Prerequisites
List everything needed before reproduction can begin:
- Required modules / spawners that must be running (e.g. Case Service, Alert Scanner)
- Specific user roles or permissions needed
- Test data that must exist (e.g. a case with open alerts, a specific alert type)
- Environment notes (e.g. Oracle vs Postgres, specific config flags)

#### 6b. Reproduction Steps
Number each step. Be explicit — do not assume prior knowledge:

```
1. Log in as a user with [role] permissions.
2. Navigate to [Screen] via [Menu path].
3. [Perform action — e.g. "Select a case with at least 2 open alerts in Alert Central."]
4. [Perform the triggering action — e.g. "Use the Actions dropdown → Change Status → RESOLVED."]
5. Navigate to Alert Central and search for the alerts that were in the case.
```

#### 6c. Expected Result
State clearly what **should** happen if the system were working correctly.

#### 6d. Actual Result (the bug / gap)
State clearly what **actually** happens — the symptom the reporter sees.

#### 6e. Replication Confidence

Same three-level gate as Step 5 (High → proceed; Medium → note assumption and proceed; Low → stop and ask developer before continuing to Step 7). State: `Replication confidence: {level} — {reason}.` If Medium or Low, list the specific unknowns or assumptions.

#### 6f. Service Restart Guidance

If the fix touches the **Plugin or Worker layer** (`fcplugin/`), state which spawner or service must be restarted locally to pick up the change:

```
To test this fix locally, restart:
  - [Spawner/Worker name] — e.g. "CaseResolutionWorker" or "AlertScannerWorker"
  - Any dependent service that loads the plugin at startup
```

If the fix touches only the **GWT Frontend** (`fcfrontend/`), state: `Frontend-only change — recompile GWT module; no backend restart required.`

If the fix touches only the **Backend API** (`fcbackend/`), state: `Backend-only change — restart the application server (Tomcat/embedded).`

If the fix touches **multiple layers**, list each service that needs restarting in the correct order.

---

### Step 7 — Root Cause Analysis

This step has two paths. **Choose the correct path based on the Decision Tree result in 7a:**

| Ticket type | Path |
|-------------|------|
| **BUG** (Data / UI / Async / Regression) | Engineering Panel → 7b through 7i |
| **ENHANCEMENT** (feature that never existed) | Direct Analysis → Step 7-ENH, then skip to Step 8 |

Do not guess — verify every claim by reading code at the specific location. The Grep-First rule applies throughout this step.

---

#### 7a. Diagnostic Decision Tree

Before anyone begins investigating, classify the failure mode. This classification drives Morgan's briefing and each engineer's focus:

```
Issue reported
    │
    ├─► BUG (defect — something that worked before or should work now)
    │       │
    │       ├─► DATA ISSUE? (wrong value stored / returned)
    │       │       ├─► Missing null/empty check → Hypothesis: NPE or silent empty result
    │       │       ├─► Wrong field read or written → Hypothesis: Field mapping error
    │       │       └─► DB query incorrect → Hypothesis: SQL / ORM misconfiguration
    │       │
    │       ├─► UI ISSUE? (screen not rendering, action not triggering)
    │       │       ├─► Event handler missing or broken → Hypothesis: GWT callback not wired
    │       │       ├─► Service call fails silently → Hypothesis: RPC error swallowed
    │       │       └─► State not refreshed after action → Hypothesis: Missing panel reload
    │       │
    │       ├─► ASYNC / TIMING ISSUE? (intermittent, race condition)
    │       │       ├─► Multiple callbacks competing → Hypothesis: Race condition
    │       │       ├─► Lock / transaction conflict → Hypothesis: Deadlock / dirty read
    │       │       └─► Worker processing order → Hypothesis: Out-of-order execution
    │       │
    │       └─► REGRESSION? (was working, now broken)
    │               ├─► Check git log on affected files (last 90 days)
    │               └─► Identify which commit introduced the change
    │
    └─► ENHANCEMENT (feature that never existed)
            ├─► Pure addition → no breakage risk; identify insertion point
            └─► Modification of existing flow → treat sub-paths as BUG branches above
```

State: `Decision tree path: {BUG → DATA ISSUE → Missing null check}` (or whichever branch matched).

**→ If ENHANCEMENT: proceed to Step 7-ENH below and skip the Engineering Panel entirely.**
**→ If BUG: proceed to 7b (Engineering Panel).**

---

#### Step 7-ENH — Enhancement Direct Analysis *(Enhancement tickets only — skip for bugs)*

Read the files identified in Step 5 and produce a direct analysis. No panel. No debate.

**7-ENH-a. What needs to be added + insertion points**

State: *"The system currently lacks X. We need to add Y at Z."* with specific `file:line` references. For each insertion point: name what already exists there, what new code goes in (field, method, config item, UI hook), and whether new fields/methods belong in the abstract base — apply the Step 5 class hierarchy rule.

**7-ENH-c. Git history check**
- Run `git log --oneline --all -- {primary_file}` for each affected file
- Confirm: no partial implementation of this feature already exists in any branch
- If a partial exists: note it explicitly and build on it rather than duplicating

**7-ENH-d. Enhancement Statement**

Produce the following block — this replaces the Root Cause Statement for Step 8:

```
ENHANCEMENT STATEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What is missing : [one sentence — what the system cannot currently do]
Insertion points: [file:line for each touch point]
Approach        : [one paragraph — the design decision, e.g. new field
                  in AbstractJsonListener wired through getConfig() in
                  the concrete class; new UI config item; new DB column]
Class hierarchy : [N/A / Confirmed concrete class is correct /
                   Moved to {AbstractBase} — {N} sibling classes benefit]
Partial exists  : [No — confirmed by git log / Yes — {branch:file:line}]
Confidence      : High / Medium / Low
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If confidence is **Low** (insertion points unclear after reading the code), stop and ask the developer for clarification before proceeding to Step 8.

**→ After completing Step 7-ENH, skip to Step 8 directly.**

---

#### 7b-pre. Complexity Gate *(Bug tickets only)*

Before convening the full panel, Morgan performs a **2-op pre-assessment** to decide whether the full panel is needed or a fast-path is sufficient.

**Pre-assessment (≤ 2 ops):**
1. Count files in the Step 5 file map and run a quick caller count: `grep -r "{primary_method}" "$REPO_DIR" | wc -l`
2. Check whether Step 0b surfaced a Prior Knowledge hit with High confidence on the same component and pattern

**Complexity verdict:**

| Signal | Fast-path? |
|--------|-----------|
| ≤ 2 files in file map AND ≤ 5 callers AND KB hit (High confidence, same component + pattern) | **Yes** — fast-path |
| Any signal outside those bounds | **No** — full panel |

**Fast-path mode** (skips mid-point check-in and full cross-examination):
- KB short-circuit: Morgan opens with `"KB identifies [Pattern/Rule] as likely mechanism — engineers confirm or rule out, 4 ops each maximum. No fresh investigation needed unless the evidence contradicts KB."`
- Each engineer submits one concise hypothesis block (no structured investigation narrative)
- Riley gives a one-line risk rating instead of a full Testing Impact Assessment
- Morgan's verdict in 3 sentences; no formal debate round
- Emit `[FAST-PATH]` tag in the output so the PDF labels it clearly

State: `Complexity gate: {Fast-path / Full panel} — {one-line reason}`

---

#### Engineering Panel *(Bug tickets only — 7b through 7i)*

**The team:**

| Role | Name | Background | Mandate |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Lead Developer** | **Morgan** | 20 yrs Java, ex-systems architect, deep GWT/Spring/Oracle | Chairs the session. Sets schedule. Reviews all hypotheses. Debates. Gives final verdict. Approves the Root Cause Statement. |
| Senior Engineer 1 | Alex | 12 yrs Java/GWT | Code archaeology & regression forensics |
| Senior Engineer 2 | Sam | 10 yrs full-stack Java, Spring, GWT RPC | Runtime data flow & logic tracing |
| Senior Engineer 3 | Jordan | 15 yrs Java, systems architect background | Defensive patterns & structural anti-patterns |
| **Senior Lead Tester** | **Riley** | 18 yrs QA & test architecture, Java enterprise, GWT, regression suites | Assesses testability and impact of each hypothesis. Questions engineer findings. Flags regression risk and edge cases. Riley's concerns are factored into Morgan's verdict and Fix Review. |
| **Scrum Master** | **Bryan** | 15 yrs agile delivery, process optimisation, token & cost efficiency | Silent observer for Steps 0–13. Does not intervene in the investigation. Convenes Step 14 retrospective at the end of every session (Dev and PR Review alike) to audit process friction, token spend, and propose one focused SKILL.md improvement per session. |

Engineers (Alex, Sam, Jordan) are competing for the **Best Analysis** distinction. Morgan is not competing — Morgan arbitrates. Morgan's verdict is binding and may endorse, refine, or override any engineer's hypothesis. Riley is not competing — Riley challenges and assesses from a testing perspective. Bryan is not part of the investigation — Bryan observes the whole session and acts only in Step 14.

---

#### 7b. Morgan Opens — Historical JIRA Search + Lead Briefing

Before briefing the team, Morgan performs a mandatory JIRA historical investigation to determine whether this issue — or a closely related one — has been encountered and resolved before. Prior resolutions may contain root cause analysis, fix locations, or regression notes that the team can immediately build on.

##### 7b-i. Morgan's JIRA Historical Search

Morgan runs the following JQL queries using `mcp__jira__jira_search` or `mcp__plugin_atlassian_atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`:

```
-- Query 1: Same component(s), closed/resolved, keyword match on current summary
project = IV
AND component in ("{COMPONENTS}")
AND status in (Done, Resolved, Closed)
AND summary ~ "{KEY_TERM_1}" OR summary ~ "{KEY_TERM_2}"
ORDER BY updated DESC

-- Query 2: Same label(s), closed/resolved — broader net
project = IV
AND labels in ("{LABELS}")
AND status in (Done, Resolved, Closed)
ORDER BY updated DESC
```

Limit to 10 results per query. For each ticket returned:
1. Retrieve full details (summary, description, comments, resolution note, assignee, fix version).
2. Scan comments for: root cause statements, file:line references to the fix, investigation notes, known regressions introduced by the fix.
3. Classify relevance: **High** (same component + same symptom), **Medium** (same component, different symptom), **Low** (related label only).
4. Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` or `[KB+ ARCH]` markers for any business rule or architecture insight discovered in the historical tickets that is not already in the Prior Knowledge block.

Present the Historical JIRA Precedents block before the team briefing:

```
┌─ Morgan — Historical JIRA Precedents ────────────────────────────────┐
│ Searched  : component={COMPONENTS}, label={LABELS}, status=Closed    │
│ Found     : {N} related past ticket(s)                               │
│                                                                      │
│ [IV-XXXX] ({date}) {summary}  — Relevance: High/Medium/Low          │
│   Status   : {Closed/Resolved} | Fix version: {version}             │
│   Root cause (from comments): {one-line summary or "Not documented"} │
│   Fix area : {file:method:line if mentioned, else "Not documented"}  │
│   Risk note: {any regression warning from comments or "None"}        │
│                                                                      │
│ [IV-YYYY] ...                                                        │

│ Team note: {one of:}                                                 │
│   "IV-XXXX is directly relevant — Alex/Jordan, start from that fix." │
│   "Past tickets found but no documented root cause — fresh start."   │
│   "No past tickets found on these components/labels."                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If JIRA search fails (MCP unavailable): log `JIRA_SEARCH_WARN: historical search unavailable` and continue. Do not block the session.

If no matching tickets are found: state "No historical tickets found on these components/labels — proceeding fresh."

##### 7b-ii. Morgan Lead Briefing (1-minute block)

Morgan reads the ticket summary, the file map from Step 5, the replication guide from Step 6, the decision tree classification, the Prior Knowledge block (Step 0b), and the Historical JIRA Precedents above. Morgan then opens the session:

```
┌─ Morgan — Lead Briefing ────────────────────────────────────────────┐

#### 7c. Parallel Investigation — Engineers and Tester Investigate (4-minute block)

Each engineer has a **4-minute investigation window**, capped at **8 targeted grep/read operations** before committing to a hypothesis. The budget enforces focus: reach defensible conclusions quickly, not exhaustively.

**Riley — conditional timing:** Riley does NOT run in parallel by default. After the hypothesis round, Morgan checks whether all three engineers converge on the same root cause with High confidence. If yes, Riley gives a **one-line risk rating** only (no full Testing Impact Assessment block). If any engineer diverges or confidence is Medium/Low, Riley runs the full 6-op Testing Impact Assessment before Morgan's cross-examination.

**Budget rules (apply to Alex, Sam, and Jordan):**
- **High-confidence evidence found in ≤ 4 ops?** Stop immediately and go to mid-point check-in. Do not over-investigate.
- **No clear hypothesis after 8 ops?** Commit to the best available hypothesis, rate it Medium or Low confidence, and state explicitly what additional information would confirm it.
- Every claim must be backed by a specific `file:line` or commit reference. Unsupported assertions will be challenged by Morgan.
- Present findings as if briefing a tech lead: precise, brief, right.

**Budget rules (Riley):**
- 6 operations maximum — Riley is mapping impact, not tracing code.
- Operations count reads of the ticket description, Step 2/5/6 outputs, and any targeted grep/file reads.
- Riley does not need to find the root cause — Riley needs to answer: *"If the fix goes where the engineers think, what breaks, what is untestable, and what are the edge cases?"*

---

**Alex — Code History & Regression**
*"Every bug has a birthday. Find the commit, find the cause."*

Operations (in priority order — stop early if High confidence is reached):
1. `git log --oneline -10 -- {primary_file}` for each file in the Step 5 file map
2. `git log --oneline --since="90 days ago" -- {primary_file}` for broader history
3. Identify the most recent commit touching the relevant method or class
4. Inspect the suspect commit: `git show {commit_hash} -- {file}` — read only relevant diff hunks
5. Check if the issue correlates with a version branch merge or cherry-pick
6. For enhancement tickets: confirm no partial implementation exists in git history
7. Cross-reference suspect commit date with related Jira tickets in comments
8. Confirm fix path is clear of conflicting in-progress changes on the branch

**Alex KB annotations:** Emit `[KB+ RISK]` for any widely-coupled area found via git blame. Emit `[KB+ ARCH]` if git history reveals an architectural decision (e.g. "this class was split in commit X because Y"). Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` if a commit message or JIRA cross-reference reveals a business rule that drove a past change.

---

**Sam — Data Flow & Runtime Logic**
*"Follow the data. The divergence point is the bug."*

Operations (in priority order — stop early if High confidence is reached):
1. Locate the entry point from Step 5 (UI event handler, API endpoint, worker trigger)
2. Read the entry method (relevant line range — Grep-First applies)
3. Follow the first significant call in the chain — grep, then read the target method
4. Continue layer by layer: UI → service → DAO/plugin → DB until divergence is found
5. At each hop: is correct data present? Is a null check missing? Is a flag propagated?
6. Identify the exact line where actual state deviates from required state
7. Verify fix direction: confirm the correct value *would* be available if the divergence is patched
8. Note secondary effects downstream of the divergence point

Additional Sam checks at every hop:
- GWT async callback result used outside its callback scope?
- Method return value silently discarded?
- Conditional branch short-circuits before the critical operation executes?
- Service method calling a deprecated path instead of the updated one?

**Sam KB annotations:** Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` for every domain invariant implied by the data flow (e.g. "field X must be set before service Y is called"). Emit `[KB+ ARCH]` when a new layer interaction is discovered (e.g. "plugin workers communicate back to FRAMS via event bus, not direct call"). Emit `[KB+ RISK]` when a widely-used service method or shared state is identified as a potential regression point.

---

**Jordan — Defensive Patterns & Structural Anti-Patterns**
*"I've catalogued every way Java developers shoot themselves in the foot."*

Jordan checks patterns in priority order driven by the decision tree classification:

| Pri | Pattern | What Jordan checks |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Null Pointer** | Object dereferenced without a prior null guard. Jordan checks all six sub-cases: **(a) Service/RPC return** — result of a service call, RPC, or REST response used directly without null check; **(b) Map.get() result** — `map.get(key)` used without null guard (key may be absent); **(c) Method chain** — `a.getB().getC().getValue()` with no intermediate null guard — any link can be null; **(d) Null unboxing** — `Integer`/`Long`/`Boolean` field auto-unboxed in an arithmetic or boolean expression while the wrapper is null; **(e) String comparison** — `str.equals("literal")` where `str` may be null — should be `"literal".equals(str)` or an explicit null guard; **(f) For-each on null collection** — enhanced `for` loop over a field or return value that could be null (no empty-collection guard, distinct from pattern #5 which covers size/`.get(0)` on a non-null list). |
| 2 | **Boolean Flag Not Reset** | Flag set in one path but never cleared in the complementary path |
| 3 | **GWT Async Callback Lost** | Async callback result used outside its own closure scope |
| 4 | **Silent Exception Swallow** | Catch block empty or logging only — masking the real failure |
| 5 | **Empty Collection Guard** | List iterated or `.get(0)` called without size/null check |
| 6 | **Partial Transaction** | DB write immediately depended upon in the next call without flush |
| 7 | **Missing Method Override** | New overload added to interface/abstract class, not implemented in subclass |
| 8 | **Wrong Layer Call** | UI code directly accessing DAO or utility, bypassing the service layer |
| 9 | **DB Dialect Gap** | `ROWNUM` vs `LIMIT`, `NVL` vs `COALESCE`, `SYSDATE` vs `NOW()` etc. |
| 10 | **Thread Safety** | Shared field read/written from multiple threads without synchronisation |
| 11 | **Wrong Ownership Level** | New fields or methods placed in a concrete class when the abstract base is the correct owner. Check: does the concrete class extend an abstract base that already owns similar infrastructure (e.g. fields, utility methods, config helpers)? `grep "extends {AbstractBase}"` to find all siblings — if siblings exist or would benefit, the new state belongs in the abstract base; only config wiring (`getConfig()` items, `setAttribute()` cases) stays in the concrete class. |
| 12 | **Resource Leak** | `Connection`, `InputStream`, `ResultSet`, or other `Closeable` opened but not closed in a `finally` block or `try-with-resources` — especially in exception paths where the happy-path close is bypassed. |
| 13 | **Mutable Static State** | Static fields that are non-final and mutable — in a servlet container these are shared across requests and threads, causing cross-request contamination. Non-final statics are a silent shared-state bug. |
| 14 | **Leaking Abstraction** | Implementation-specific types (e.g., a DAO exception class, an ORM entity) surfacing in the service or UI layer — the layer boundary was breached at the type level, not just the call level. Complements pattern #8 (Wrong Layer Call). |
| 15 | **Circular Dependency** | Package A imports package B which imports package A — violates clean layering and signals a design split that was never completed. Check for cycles at the package level when a new import is added. |
| 16 | **Breaking API Change** | Public method signature changed (parameter added/removed, type changed, checked exception added) without a backward-compatible overload — any existing caller becomes a compile or runtime failure. |
| 17 | **equals/hashCode Contract Broken** | `equals()` overridden without `hashCode()` (or vice versa), or `hashCode()` includes a mutable field — objects placed in `HashSet` or `HashMap` silently misbehave. |
| 18 | **Serialization Mismatch** | `Serializable` class had fields added or removed without updating `serialVersionUID` — relevant in GWT where DTOs cross the wire and persisted sessions may deserialize stale versions. |
| 19 | **Unchecked Cast Without Guard** | `(SomeType) obj` cast not preceded by an `instanceof` check — a `ClassCastException` waiting on a non-obvious code path, typically in a generic handler or polymorphic dispatch. |
| 20 | **Hardcoded Environment Value** | IP addresses, port numbers, timeouts, or threshold values baked into logic rather than pulled from config — breaks silently when deployed to a different environment. |

Priority order by classification: UI issues → {1, 2, 3, 4}; Data issues → {1, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13}; Async issues → {3, 7, 10}; Regressions → {2, 8, 17, 18}; Enhancements → {11, 7, 16}; Architecture → {14, 15, 19, 20}.

**Jordan KB annotations:** For every pattern match: emit `[KB+ PAT] Pattern #{N}: {description} — {file:line} [NEW]` on first occurrence or `[KB+ PAT] Pattern #{N}: {description} — {file:line} [BUMP]` if already in KB. If a structural anti-pattern (wrong ownership level, circular dependency, leaking abstraction) reveals an architecture insight: also emit `[KB+ ARCH]`.

**Riley — Testing Impact & Regression Assessment**
*"A fix that can't be verified is a fix that can't be trusted."*

Operations (in priority order — stop when impact picture is clear):
1. Re-read the ticket's expected behaviour and acceptance criteria (Step 2 problem statement)
2. Review the Step 6 replication guide — assess completeness; identify gaps (missing preconditions, untested data states, concurrent-user scenarios)
3. From the Step 5 file map, identify every user-facing flow that passes through the affected files — not just the primary path
4. For each affected flow: what does a tester do to confirm it works after the fix? Is the fix observable from the UI/API, or does it require DB-level verification?
5. Enumerate edge cases the engineer hypotheses have not addressed: null/empty inputs, DB dialect differences, multi-client data isolation, state at session boundaries
6. Assess the regression surface: list existing behaviours that the proposed fix direction could silently break — focus on shared utilities, common service methods, and anything called by more than one screen

Riley does **not** assert a root cause. Riley asserts impact, risk, and testability.

**Riley KB annotations:** Emit `[KB+ RISK]` for every area identified as fragile (shared methods, widely-used utilities, cross-screen state). Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` if an acceptance criterion implies a domain rule (e.g. "system must not allow X in state Y"). These become regression risk and business rule entries in the KB.

#### 7d. Mid-Point Check-In — T+2 minutes

Each engineer submits a brief progress report to Morgan after approximately 4 operations used. Morgan acknowledges, redirects if needed, or issues a targeted follow-up question.

```
─── Mid-Point Check-In ────────────────────────────────────────────

Alex (ops used: N/8):
  Status: [e.g. "Found a suspect commit — diffing now" or "Nothing
           suspicious yet in history — broadening to 90-day range"]

Sam (ops used: N/8):
  Status: [e.g. "Traced to service layer — divergence likely in
           resolveCase(); reading next" or "Entry method is thin —
           tracing into the callback chain"]

Jordan (ops used: N/8):
  Status: [e.g. "Pattern #2 matched early — Boolean Flag Not Reset
           confirmed at CaseManager.java:2272" or "No clear pattern
           yet — continuing through lower-priority checks"]

Riley (ops used: N/6):
  Status: [e.g. "Three affected flows identified — the fix direction
           Sam is heading towards would be testable from the UI.
           Flagging one edge case: the cancel path is not covered
           by the replication guide." or "Impact surface is wider
           than expected — two other screens call the same service
           method. Flagging regression risk."]

─── Morgan's Response ─────────────────────────────────────────────

[Morgan reads all four statuses and responds with one of:]

  ✓ On track — continue as assigned.

  ↻ Redirect: [e.g. "Alex, the commit you're looking at is from
    a different branch — check the merge commit instead." or
    "Sam, skip the DAO layer for now — the UI handler is more
    likely; go back and read resolveCase() directly." or
    "Riley, the cancel path concern is valid — make sure you
    have a test scenario for it in your assessment."]

  ⚡ Early call: [e.g. "Jordan, if you've confirmed that pattern
    at line 2272 with code evidence, stop — that's enough. Write
    your hypothesis now and let the others finish."]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### 7e. Hypothesis Submission + Testing Assessment — T+4 minutes

All three engineers submit their final hypotheses. Riley submits a Testing Impact Assessment simultaneously. Each entry must fit the template exactly — no unsupported claims.

```

```

Riley's assessment is **not scored** — it is advisory. However, any **High regression risk** or unanswered **Open question** must be explicitly addressed by Morgan in the verdict (7h) and Fix Review (8c).

---

#### 7f. Riley's Questions + Morgan's Cross-Examination — T+5 minutes

Riley poses the **Open question** from the Testing Impact Assessment directly to the named engineer or Morgan. Then Morgan reads all hypotheses and the testing assessment, and poses **1–2 targeted probing questions** to stress-test reasoning. Engineers respond in one paragraph — direct, evidence-backed.

```
─── Riley's Question ──────────────────────────────────────────────

Riley → {Engineer name or Morgan}:
  "[The Open question from Riley's assessment — e.g. 'Sam, your
   fix touches resolveCase() which is also called from the Alert
   Central panel. Have you confirmed that path is not affected?'
   or 'Jordan, you flagged Boolean Flag Not Reset — does the flag
   have the same reset gap on the cancel path, or only on error?']"

{Engineer} responds:
  [Direct answer — one paragraph, backed by file:line evidence
   or explicit acknowledgement if the concern stands unresolved]

─── Morgan's Questions ────────────────────────────────────────────

[Morgan selects the most important uncertainties across the three
hypotheses and Riley's assessment, then asks them directly. Examples:]

  → To Alex: "You say commit abc1234 is responsible. What was the
    stated reason for that change? Was it deliberate removal or
    accidental? Does the commit message or linked ticket clarify?"

  → To Sam: "You found the divergence at resolveCase():2272. Does
    the flag actually exist in scope at that point, or does the fix
    require introducing a new field entirely?"

  → To Jordan: "You matched Boolean Flag Not Reset. Does the flag
    get reset anywhere else in the class — e.g. on cancel or on
    error? Or is this the only path that should set it?"

─── Engineers Respond ─────────────────────────────────────────────

Alex responds: [direct answer — one paragraph, backed by evidence]

Sam responds: [direct answer — one paragraph, backed by evidence]

Jordan responds: [direct answer — one paragraph, backed by evidence]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Morgan uses up to **4 additional targeted reads** (beyond the engineers' budgets) to independently verify any claim that cannot be confirmed from the responses alone.

---

#### 7g. Team Debate — One Round

Morgan opens the floor for one round of cross-challenge. Any engineer **or Riley** may mount one challenge. Engineers challenge on code grounds; Riley challenges on impact or testability grounds. The challenged party responds once. Morgan moderates.

```
─── Debate Round ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Each challenge must cite specific evidence. Format:]

  {Engineer A or Riley} challenges {Engineer B}:
  "Your hypothesis says X, but I found Y at {file:line} which
  contradicts that because Z. My reading suggests [alternative]."

  — or, from Riley —

  "Your fix direction touches {file/method} which is also called
  from {other screen/flow}. I flagged this in my assessment.
  Without a guard at {location}, this fix will silently break
  {behaviour} for {scenario}. Have you accounted for that?"

  {Engineer B} responds:
  "That's a fair point. [Agree / Disagree because {evidence}].
  My hypothesis [stands / needs refinement: {updated claim}]."

  [Morgan may accept or reject refinements — one sentence each.]

─── Morgan closes debate ──────────────────────────────────────────
  "We have enough. Let me give my assessment."
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If no one mounts a challenge, state: "No challenges — team and tester accept each other's findings."

---

#### 7h. Morgan's Verdict — T+6 minutes

Morgan weighs all evidence — original hypotheses, responses to questions, and the debate — then delivers a binding verdict. Morgan scores each hypothesis and declares the adopted root cause.

**Scoring rubric** (Morgan applies this to each hypothesis):

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Specific `file:line` cited with code evidence | +3 |
| Fix direction is clear and immediately actionable | +2 |
| Explains *why* the bug is intermittent (if applicable) | +2 |
| Self-rated High confidence and evidence supports it | +1 |
| Corroborated by another engineer's independent finding | +2 |
| Found efficiently (≤ 5 ops used) | +1 |
| Survived cross-examination without needing revision | +2 |
| Debate challenge successfully deflected with evidence | +1 |
| Fix direction is testable and Riley raised no High regression risk against it | +1 |

Maximum score: 15 pts. Morgan applies the rubric, declares the highest scorer the winner, then issues a personal assessment — which **must** include a response to Riley's assessment.

```
─── Morgan's Verdict ──────────────────────────────────────────────

Scores:
  Alex   : {N} / 15 pts — [one-line assessment]
  Sam    : {N} / 15 pts — [one-line assessment]
  Jordan : {N} / 15 pts — [one-line assessment]

Tester's view:
  [Morgan addresses Riley's assessment — one to two sentences.
   Must state whether the adopted root cause and fix direction
   address Riley's regression risk and open question. If a High
   severity concern from Riley is unresolved, Morgan must state
   whether it is accepted risk or a blocker for the fix.]

My assessment:
  [Morgan weighs in personally — 2–4 sentences. Morgan may:
   (a) Endorse the highest-scoring hypothesis unchanged
   (b) Refine it: "Jordan's hypothesis is correct but incomplete —
       Sam's flow trace shows the flag is also missing on the
       cancel path, which explains the intermittent reports."
   (c) Override all three: "None of you went deep enough. I ran
       one more read on {file} and found {what Morgan found}."
   Morgan's assessment takes precedence over the score alone.]

Adopted root cause: [the hypothesis Morgan endorses, possibly
                     refined or Morgan's own if override]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Verdict outcomes:**

| Outcome | Block displayed |
|---------|----------------|
| One engineer's score is clearly highest + Morgan agrees | `🏆 BEST ANALYSIS: {Name}` |
| Two or more engineers independently reached the same cause | `🤝 CONSENSUS: {Name} & {Name}` |
| Morgan refined the winning hypothesis | `🏆 BEST ANALYSIS: {Name}` + `📝 Refined by Morgan` note |
| Morgan overrode all three | `⚡ MORGAN OVERRIDE — independent read required` |

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🏆  BEST ANALYSIS: {Engineer Name}        Score: {N} / 15 pts  ║
║  Reason: {One sentence — why this analysis was superior}         ║
║  Morgan: "{One sentence endorsement or refinement note}"         ║
║  Riley:  "{One sentence — tester concern status: resolved /      ║
║            accepted risk / flagged for fix review}"              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

#### 7i. Root Cause Statement — Team Sign-Off

Produce the final root cause statement — authored by the winning engineer and approved by Morgan. This anchors Step 8.

```
ROOT CAUSE STATEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Author    : {Winning Engineer Name}  |  Approved by: Morgan
Location  : {file:line}
Mechanism : [How the bug manifests — precise, code-level description]
Trigger   : [What user action or system event makes it observable]
Fix dir.  : [One sentence on the correct fix — detail in Step 8]
Confidence: High / Medium / Low
Team note : [Optional — one sentence capturing any nuance raised in
             the debate that the fix author must not overlook]
Tester note: [Riley's key concern or confirmation — e.g. "Regression
              risk on Alert Central resolve path — must be smoke-tested
              after fix applied" or "Fix is UI-observable; no DB
              verification required" — omit if no concern outstanding]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

If overall confidence is **Low** after Morgan's verdict (no clear root cause even after debate), **stop and present the competing hypotheses to the developer**. In headless mode, proceed with the highest-scoring hypothesis and flag the ambiguity explicitly.

---

### Step 8 — Propose the Fix

Use the analysis from Step 7 as the mandatory anchor:
- **Bug tickets** — anchor to the Root Cause Statement from Step 7i (authored by the winning engineer, approved by Morgan). Every proposed change must directly address the mechanism stated there.
- **Enhancement tickets** — anchor to the Enhancement Statement from Step 7-ENH-d. Every proposed change must directly implement an insertion point listed there.

#### 8a. Proposed Solution
- Open by quoting the analysis anchor — the Root Cause Statement (bug tickets) or Enhancement Statement (enhancement tickets) — verbatim; do not paraphrase
- Describe the approach in plain language before showing any code
- Show **only the code that needs to change** (diff-style or clear before/after blocks)
- Annotate each change with: *"This addresses the [mechanism / insertion point] identified in Step 7"*
- If the Step 7 Team Note (bug) or Step 7-ENH confidence note (enhancement) flagged a nuance, confirm it is handled by the proposed fix

#### 8b. Alternative Approaches Considered

For each alternative considered and rejected, provide a brief entry:

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| {approach} | {reason — e.g. higher risk, side effects, does not address root cause mechanism} |

If only one viable approach exists, state: "No viable alternatives identified — single fix path confirmed."

#### 8c. Morgan Reviews the Proposed Fix

Before applying anything, Morgan vetted the proposed fix against the adopted root cause. Morgan checks:

1. **Mechanism alignment** — does the fix directly address the mechanism stated in the Root Cause Statement?
2. **Surgical scope** — is the fix minimal? Does it avoid touching code unrelated to the root cause?
3. **Regression risk** — does the fix introduce any new null risks, flag side effects, or break the complementary code path?
4. **Team note honoured** — if a nuance was flagged in Step 7i, is it handled?
5. **DB safety** *(skip if no schema change included)* — is the change safe on both Oracle and PostgreSQL?
6. **Abstract class ownership** *(skip if no new fields, methods, or getters/setters added to a concrete class)* — confirm whether the abstract base is the correct owner. Run `grep "extends {AbstractBase}" --include="*.java"` to list siblings. Only `getConfig()` registrations and `setAttribute()` switch cases are concrete-class concerns; everything else belongs in the abstract base when a suitable one exists.
7. **Tester concerns** *(skip if Riley raised no High or Medium concerns in Step 7e)* — for each High/Medium concern, confirm the fix addresses it or state accepted risk and why.

```
─── Morgan's Fix Review ───────────────────────────────────────────

Mechanism alignment      : [Confirmed / Issue: {what is misaligned}]
Surgical scope           : [Confirmed — N files, M lines changed /
                            Concern: {what is unnecessarily wide}]
Regression risk          : [Low — no new risks introduced /
                            Flag: {specific risk Morgan identified}]
Team note honoured       : [Yes / Not applicable / No — {what is missing}]
DB safety                : [Confirmed / N/A — no schema change /
                            Issue: {dialect problem spotted}]
Abstract class ownership : [N/A — no new fields or methods added /
                            Confirmed — concrete class is correct owner /
                            Moved to {AbstractBase} — {N} sibling subclasses
                            benefit; config wiring stays in concrete class]
Tester concerns          : [N/A — no High or Medium concerns raised /
                            Resolved — {Riley's concern} is addressed by
                            {specific change in the fix} /
                            Accepted risk — {Riley's concern} is not
                            addressed; accepted because {reason}]

Morgan's verdict:
  ✅ APPROVED — fix is correct, surgical, and safe to apply.

  — or —

  ⚠️  APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS — apply after addressing:
     [{specific condition Morgan requires before applying}]

  — or —

  🔄 REWORK REQUIRED — [{reason}]. Suggested direction:
     [{Morgan's suggested fix approach — one paragraph}]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**If Morgan returns REWORK REQUIRED:**
- Revise the proposed solution in 8a to address Morgan's direction
- Re-run Morgan's review (8c) against the revised fix
- Do not proceed to 8d until Morgan's verdict is Approved or Approved with Conditions

#### 8d. Apply Fix to Feature Branch (Interactive)

After Morgan approves the fix, ask the developer:

> **Would you like me to apply these changes to the feature branch now?**
> - `yes` — apply all proposed changes directly to the files on the current feature branch
> - `no` — skip; the developer will apply manually
> - `partial` — ask which specific changes to apply

If the developer answers **yes** or **partial**:
- Use the Edit tool to apply changes to each identified file
- After each file is modified, confirm: "Applied change to `{file}:{line}`"
- Do NOT commit — leave the changes staged for the developer to review and commit using the suggested message from Step 10c

If the developer answers **no**, continue to Step 9 without modifying any files.

#### 8e. DB Migration (if needed)
If the fix requires schema changes, provide the upgrade script template:
```sql
-- v1.XX.XXX.sql / .pg
-- IV-XXXX: <description>
ALTER TABLE ...
```

---

### Step 9 — Impact Analysis

**Context pruning** — before beginning Step 9, explicitly summarise the Engineering Panel output down to its essential residue for the remaining steps. The verbatim debate, cross-examination, and scoring are preserved in the PDF and do not need to remain active in the context window:

> *Panel summary retained for Steps 9–12: Root Cause Statement + Team Note + Morgan's Fix Review verdict. Full panel transcript is in the PDF.*

This keeps the context window lean for the grep-heavy impact analysis steps.

Assess the full consequences of the proposed fix across the entire application. This step requires active codebase searching — do not rely on assumptions. Use Grep to find every reference to changed symbols before drawing conclusions.

#### 9a. Files Changed
List every file touched by the fix with a one-line description of what changed and why:

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Added `pendingAlertResolve` flag and async callback chain | Core fix for alert resolution |
| `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/v1.XX.XXX.sql` | New table / column | Schema required for fix |

#### 9b. Usage Reference Search (mandatory)

For **every method, class, field, or API endpoint** modified by the fix, search the full codebase for all callers and references:

```
Grep: {modified method or class name} → across {REPO_DIR}/
```

For each symbol changed, produce a reference table:

| Symbol Changed | Type | Callers / References Found | Files |
|----------------|------|---------------------------|-------|
| `resolveAlertCentral(...)` | method | 3 callers | `CaseManager.java`, `AlertCentral.java`, `CaseDetailsPanel.java` |
| `pendingAlertResolve` | field | local to `CaseManager` | `CaseManager.java` only |

Rules:
- If a changed method is `private` — **skip the codebase-wide grep**; confirm it is only called within the same class (one targeted read). Do not search the full repo for private symbols — it is redundant and wastes ops.
- If a changed method is `package-private` (no modifier in Java) — grep only within the same package directory, not the full repo.
- If a changed method is `public` or `protected` — grep only the modules likely to call it, derived from the Step 5 file map (e.g. if the fix is in `fcfrontend/`, search `fcfrontend/` and `fcbuild/` first; only expand to the full repo if references are found that suggest broader coupling).
- If a changed interface or abstract method — find all implementing classes.
- If a DB column or table is changed — grep for all SQL references and ORM mappings to that table/column.
- If a GWT RPC service method signature changes — find all client call sites and the corresponding server-side implementation.

#### 9c. Application-Wide Impact

Based on the usage reference search, describe the impact across each application layer:

| Layer | Impact | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GWT Frontend | e.g. Medium | `CaseManager` change affects resolve flow; 2 other panels call same service |
| Backend API | e.g. Low | No API signature change; internal logic only |
| Plugin / Workers | e.g. None | No worker classes reference changed code |
| DB / Schema | e.g. High | Column rename affects 4 SQL queries across 3 upgrade scripts |
| Shared Utilities | e.g. Low | `RecordHelper` change only affects timed-wait resume path |

If a layer is not affected, state "None — confirmed by grep (0 references found)."

#### 9d. Regression Risks
For each change, identify what existing behaviour could break:
- Which existing flows pass through the modified code?
- Could the DB change affect existing data or other screens that read the same table?
- Flag any race conditions, null pointer risks, or async timing concerns introduced
- Flag any callers found in 9b that may behave differently after the change

#### 9e. Affected Clients / Environments
State whether the fix is:
- **Generic** — affects all clients running this version
- **Client-specific** — only affects a named client (e.g. FNB, VCL, DRC) due to config or data differences
- **DB-specific** — behaviour differs between Oracle and PostgreSQL implementations

#### 9f. Related Areas to Retest
List screens, flows, or features outside the primary fix that should be smoke-tested — derived from the callers found in 9b:
- e.g. "Alert Central resolve button should still work independently"
- e.g. "Case Details tab resolve should behave the same as All Cases tab"

#### 9g. Risk Level

Rate the overall risk of the change based on the usage reference search results:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Low** | Change is isolated; 0–1 callers found; no shared utilities or DB touched; easy to revert |
| **Medium** | 2–5 callers found; touches shared logic or a secondary screen; regression testing recommended |
| **High** | 6+ callers found; modifies a public API, shared utility, or DB schema; thorough QA required before release |

State the rating prominently:

> **Risk Level: Medium** — 3 callers of `resolveAlertCentral` found across 2 screens; existing Alert Central resolve path must be retested.

---

### Step 10 — Change Summary

Produce a concise, developer-friendly summary of everything that was done. This serves as a reference for commit messages, PR descriptions, and handover notes.

#### 10a. Files Touched

List every file modified, created, or deleted by the fix:

| File | Action | Summary of Change |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Modified | Added alert resolution chain triggered on case resolve |
| `fcbuild/scripts/upgrades/v1.XX.XXX.sql` | Created | Added new table `B_TR_TASK_RESPONSES` |

#### 10b. What Was Changed and Why

For each file, one short paragraph explaining:
- What was changed (the what)
- Why it was necessary to make this change (the why)
- Any notable decisions or trade-offs made

#### 10c. Suggested Commit Message

Provide a ready-to-use commit message following the project convention:

```
{VERSION}_{TICKET_KEY} {Short description of fix}

- {Bullet point of key change 1}
- {Bullet point of key change 2}
```

Example:
```
IV3672_Resolving_Cases_should_Resolve_Alerts_1.26.064 IV3672 Mustakeem Lee

- Added pendingAlertResolve flag to trigger alert resolution after case save
- Added ScreenCallBackAlertsForResolve to fetch and filter unresolved alerts
- Added ScreenCallBackResolveAlerts to finalise resolution via resolveAlertCentral
```

#### 10d. PR Description Template

Provide a ready-to-paste pull request description:

```
## {TICKET_KEY} — {Ticket Summary}

**Jira:** {JIRA_URL}/browse/{TICKET_KEY}
**Branch:** {feature branch name}
**Base:** {base branch}
**Risk:** {Low / Medium / High} — {one-line justification from Step 9g}

---

## Root Cause
{Root Cause Statement from Step 7d — location, mechanism, trigger}

## What changed
{One paragraph describing the fix — the what and the why}

## Files changed
{Files touched table from Step 10a — abbreviated to file name and one-line summary}

## How to test
{Reproduction steps from Step 6b, rewritten as a verification checklist}

## Retest areas
{Retest checklist from Step 9f}

## DB migration required
{Yes — run v1.XX.XXX.sql/.pg before deploying | No}
```

---

### Step 11 — Session Stats

Retrieve actual token usage from Claude Code's local logs via ccusage, then print the summary line.

**1. Run these two commands:**

```bash
npx --yes ccusage@latest daily --json 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
cat /tmp/.prx-session-start-spend 2>/dev/null || echo "none"
```

**2. Compute this session's cost** — today's `totalCost` from the first command minus the `totalCost` from the baseline file (second command). If the baseline file is missing or today has no entry in it, use the full daily total as the session cost.

**3. Print the summary line:**

If ccusage data is available:
```
{TICKET_KEY} | ~{N}m elapsed | ${session_cost} this session (${daily_total} today) | {input_tokens} in / {output_tokens} out (Sonnet 4.6)
```

If ccusage is unavailable (npx not found or command fails), fall back to manual estimation from the volume of content processed (Jira fields, attachments, file reads, analysis). Label estimates with `~`:
```
{TICKET_KEY} | ~{N}m elapsed | ~{X} in / ~{Y} out tokens | est. cost ${Z} (Sonnet 4.6)
```

Manual estimation pricing reference (Sonnet 4.6, fallback only):
- Input: $3.00 / 1M tokens
- Output: $15.00 / 1M tokens

---

### Step 12 — Generate PDF Analysis Report

After Step 10 is complete, generate a full PDF report of the analysis and save it to disk.

#### 12a. Configuration

Resolve the output folder using this priority order:

1. If the environment variable `CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR` is set, use it
2. Otherwise default to: `$HOME/.dev-skill/reports/`

```bash
REPORT_DIR="${CLAUDE_REPORT_DIR:-$HOME/.dev-skill/reports}"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR"
```

**PDF tool pre-check** — before generating Markdown, verify which conversion method is available and report it upfront rather than discovering failures at conversion time:

```bash
PDF_METHOD=""
if command -v pandoc &>/dev/null; then
  PDF_METHOD="pandoc"
elif ls "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" &>/dev/null \
     || command -v google-chrome &>/dev/null \
     || command -v chromium &>/dev/null; then
  PDF_METHOD="chrome"
else
  PDF_METHOD="html-fallback"
fi
echo "PDF method: $PDF_METHOD"
```

State the detected method before proceeding. If `html-fallback`, warn the developer immediately:
> "⚠️ Neither pandoc nor Chrome found — report will be saved as HTML. Install pandoc (`brew install pandoc`) or Chrome to enable PDF output."

#### 12b. Generate Markdown Source

Write `/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md`. Reproduce every step's full output — no summaries, truncation, or omissions. Placeholders below are structural guides; replace each with the actual step content.

#### 12c. Convert to PDF

Try each method in order, stopping at the first that succeeds. These methods work reliably on macOS, Linux, and Windows without platform-specific library dependencies.

**Method 1 — `pandoc` (preferred, best cross-platform support):**

Check if pandoc is available:
```bash
which pandoc        # macOS / Linux
where pandoc        # Windows
```

If available, convert directly from Markdown to PDF:
```bash
pandoc /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md \
  -o "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" \
  --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf \
  -V geometry:margin=2cm \
  -V fontsize=11pt
```

If `wkhtmltopdf` is not available, try the HTML intermediary instead:
```bash
pandoc /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md \
  -o /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html \
  --standalone --metadata title="{TICKET_KEY} Analysis"
```
Then proceed to Method 2 to print the HTML to PDF.

> **Install pandoc:** https://pandoc.org/installing.html — available via `brew install pandoc` (macOS), `apt install pandoc` (Linux), or the Windows installer.

**Method 2 — Chrome / Chromium headless (no install required if Chrome is present):**

Check for a browser:
```bash
# macOS
which google-chrome || which chromium || \
  ls "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" 2>/dev/null

# Linux
which google-chrome || which chromium-browser || which chromium

# Windows (PowerShell)
where chrome
```

First convert the Markdown to a styled HTML file:
```python
python3 -c "
import markdown2, pathlib
md = pathlib.Path('/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md').read_text()
html = '''<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\">
<style>
  body{font-family:Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;margin:40px;line-height:1.7;color:#222}
  h1{color:#1a1a2e}h2{color:#16213e;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px}
  pre{background:#f4f4f4;padding:12px;border-radius:4px;overflow-x:auto}
  code{background:#f4f4f4;padding:2px 5px;border-radius:3px}
  table{border-collapse:collapse;width:100%}
  th,td{border:1px solid #ccc;padding:8px;text-align:left}
  th{background:#f0f0f0}
  blockquote{border-left:4px solid #ccc;margin:0;padding-left:16px;color:#555}
</style></head><body>''' + markdown2.markdown(md, extras=['fenced-code-blocks','tables','strike']) + '</body></html>'
pathlib.Path('/tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html').write_text(html)
"
```

Then print to PDF using Chrome headless:
```bash
# macOS
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless --no-sandbox --disable-gpu \
  --print-to-pdf="{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" \
  "file:///tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html"

# Linux
google-chrome --headless --no-sandbox --disable-gpu \
  --print-to-pdf="{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" \
  "file:///tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html"

# Windows (PowerShell)
& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" `
  --headless --disable-gpu `
  --print-to-pdf="{REPORT_DIR}\{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" `
  "file:///C:/Users/$env:USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html"
```

**Method 3 — HTML fallback** (if neither pandoc nor Chrome are available):

Save the styled HTML file produced in Method 2 directly to the report folder:
```bash
cp /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html"
```

Inform the developer:
> "PDF generation unavailable (pandoc and Chrome not found). Report saved as HTML instead. Open in any browser and use File → Print → Save as PDF to convert manually."

#### 12d. Archive and Confirm

After saving, display the following to the developer (always show both the folder and the full file path):

```
📄 Analysis Report Generated
   Folder : {REPORT_DIR}/
   File   : {REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf
   Format : PDF  ← (or "HTML (PDF libraries unavailable)" if Method 3 was used)
```

#### 12e. Email Report

After the report is confirmed saved, send it by email if `PRX_EMAIL_TO` is set.

Resolve the path to `send-report.py` relative to this skill file. The script lives at `scripts/send-report.py` in the plugin repository root. Determine the repo root by running:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 "$(dirname "$(dirname "$(dirname "$0")")")/scripts/send-report.py" \
  "{TICKET_KEY}" "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" "PDF"

# Windows (PowerShell) — use the absolute path resolved at Step 0
python scripts\send-report.py "{TICKET_KEY}" "{REPORT_DIR}\{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.pdf" "PDF"
```

If the report was saved as HTML (Method 3 fallback), pass `"HTML"` as the third argument and the `.html` path instead.

The script reads all SMTP configuration from environment variables — no arguments needed beyond the three above. It handles its own error reporting:

| Output line | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `EMAIL_SKIP: ...` | `PRX_EMAIL_TO` not set — skip silently, no error |
| `EMAIL_SENT: ...` | Email delivered successfully |
| `EMAIL_ERROR: ...` | Configuration or connection problem — log the message, do not block the session |

A failed email is **never a blocking error**. Log the `EMAIL_ERROR` line and continue to Step 12f.

After a successful send, append to the confirmation block:

```
📧 Report emailed to {PRX_EMAIL_TO}
```

#### 12f. Temp File Cleanup

After the report is confirmed saved and email (if configured) has been attempted, remove the intermediate temp files:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.md /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-analysis.html
```

If removal fails, note it but do not treat it as a blocking error.

Then end with:

> **Ready to code.** Branch is created. Start with `{primary file}:{line number}`. Refer to Step 10 for the change summary and suggested commit message when done.

---

### Step 13 — Knowledge Base: Record Learnings

After Step 12 confirms the PDF has been saved, update the knowledge base with everything learned during this session. This step makes the team smarter for the next ticket.

#### 13a. Identify What Is Worth Recording

Scan the **full session output** (all steps) and extract knowledge from two sources:

**Source 1 — `[KB+]` inline annotations** (primary source — collect every marker emitted during the session):

Scan all agent output (Steps 5, 7, 8, 9) for `[KB+]` markers. Each marker is a candidate entry. Morgan reviews the full list and confirms which are genuinely new (not already in the Prior Knowledge block) before writing.

| Marker | Writes to |
|--------|-----------|
| `[KB+ BIZ]` | `shared/business-rules.md` |
| `[KB+ ARCH]` | `shared/architecture.md` |
| `[KB+ PAT] ... [NEW]` | `shared/patterns.md` (new entry, Frequency: 1) |
| `[KB+ PAT] ... [BUMP]` | `shared/patterns.md` (increment existing Frequency) |
| `[KB+ RISK]` | `shared/regression-risks.md` |

**Source 2 — Structured session extracts** (fallback — anything not already captured by `[KB+]` markers):

| Category | Source | What to extract |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Root cause / fix** | Step 7i or Step 7-ENH-d | The root cause mechanism, affected file:line, fix applied |
| **Business rules** | Steps 2, 3, 7 | Any domain behaviour that was clarified or confirmed but not yet annotated |
| **Architecture insights** | Steps 5, 7 | Class hierarchy decisions, data flow understanding, ownership rules |
| **Recurring patterns** | Jordan's findings in Step 7 | Which of Jordan's 20 patterns appeared — check against KB to confirm NEW vs BUMP |
| **Regression risks** | Riley's assessment in Steps 7e, 9d | Areas flagged as fragile or widely coupled in Step 9 |
| **Historical JIRA precedents** | Step 7b-i (Morgan's JIRA search) | Any business rule or architecture insight discovered in past closed tickets |
| **Related tickets** | Steps 2, 3, 7b-i | Linked tickets and historical JIRA matches that provided context |

Morgan de-duplicates across both sources — if a `[KB+]` marker and a structured extract describe the same thing, write one entry, not two.

If no new knowledge was found beyond what is already in the KB (e.g. this ticket was very simple with no novel insights), do not skip Step 13 entirely. Instead:
1. Write the ticket entry (13b) — every ticket is worth recording.
2. For each CMM entry that was read during Step 0b and verified as still accurate during the session, emit `[CMM+ ... CONFIRM]` and increment its `confirmed:` counter (Step 13g). Confirmations are a first-class contribution — they signal to future agents that this fact has been independently verified multiple times.
3. State: "No new discoveries — confirming {N} Core Mental Map entries verified against live code."

**A session that writes nothing to the KB — not even a confirmation — is a missed compounding opportunity.** The only exception is if the KB was inaccessible (KB_ERROR in Step 0a).

#### 13b. Write the Ticket Entry

Create or overwrite `{KNOWLEDGE_DIR}/tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md` using the ticket entry format defined in the Knowledge Base section above. Populate every field — do not leave any section blank; use "None" if genuinely empty.

#### 13c. Update Shared Files

For each extracted item:

**Business rules** (`shared/business-rules.md`):
- Grep the file for the rule's key terms. If an existing entry covers it: append `Confirmed by: {TICKET_KEY} ({today})` to that entry. If it is genuinely new: append a new entry at the bottom following the established format.

**Architecture insights** (`shared/architecture.md`):
- Grep for the class or component name. If an entry exists: update it with new detail (edit the relevant lines). If new: append a new entry.

**Patterns** (`shared/patterns.md`):
- Grep for the pattern name or Jordan pattern number. If an existing entry matches: increment `Frequency: N → N+1` and append `{TICKET_KEY} ({today})` to the Recurrences list. If new: append a new entry with `Frequency: 1`.

**Regression risks** (`shared/regression-risks.md`):
- Grep for the area (class name, method name, or layer). If an existing risk covers it: append the new ticket reference to confirm the risk is still current. If new: append a new entry.

**Stale reference auto-heal** — for every `shared/*.md` entry that contains a `file:line` reference, validate and heal as follows (opportunistically, using only files already read or grepped during this session to avoid extra ops):

```
For each file:line reference encountered in KB entries:
  1. grep -n "{method_or_class_name}" "$REPO_DIR/{file}"
  2. VALID     → found at same line ± 5   → no change
  3. RELOCATED → found at different line  → update file:line; append [RELOCATED {skill_version}]
  4. MOVED     → not in that file; grep across REPO_DIR finds it elsewhere
                → update to new file:line; append [RELOCATED {skill_version}]
  5. DELETED   → symbol not found anywhere in REPO_DIR
                → mark entry [DELETED {skill_version}]; retain pattern/rule text
                   (knowledge of why it existed is still valuable even if the symbol is gone)
```

Emit a `[KB+ ARCH]` or `[KB+ RISK]` correction marker for each entry modified so Step 13d picks it up for INDEX.md.

#### 13d. Update INDEX.md — Memory Palace section

For every new or updated knowledge entry produced in 13b–13c:

1. **Determine which room(s)** the entry belongs to using the Room Directory (match the entry's components and labels).
2. **Compose or reuse the trigger phrase** — if the entry has a `trigger:` field, use it. If the trigger already exists in the room's table, skip (do not duplicate). If new, append a row to the room's trigger table under `## Memory Palace`.
3. **Bump pattern frequency** in the relevant trigger line if the entry is a pattern recurrence (update the trigger's entry link to point to the bumped entry).

#### 13e. Update INDEX.md — Master Index section

1. Add or update the ticket row in the `### Ticket Entries` table (include the `trigger:` field in the row).
2. Add rows for any new shared entries created in 13c (updated entries do not get new rows).
3. Update the header counts (`Triggers: N | Ticket entries: N | Shared entries: N`).
4. Update the `Updated:` date.

#### 13f. Publish KB

**If `KB_MODE=local`:** Skip all git and encryption steps. Files are already written to `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` in steps 13b–13e. Display:
```
📚 Knowledge Base Updated (local)
   Location      : {KNOWLEDGE_DIR}/
   Ticket entry  : tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md — {created / updated}
   Business rules: {N new / N confirmed}
   Architecture  : {N new / N updated}
   Patterns      : {N new / N bumped (PAT-XXX now seen {N}×)}
   Risks         : {N new / N updated}
   INDEX.md (Palace): {N triggers added to rooms: {room names}}
   INDEX.md      : {N rows added}
   Mental Map    : {N new / N confirmed / N corrected} (see Step 13g)
   Lessons       : {N new entries in lessons-learned/{developer}.md} (see Step 13h)
   Git           : local mode — no distribution
```

**If `KB_MODE=distributed`:**

**Step 1 — If encryption is enabled (`PRX_KB_KEY` is set): batch encrypt session files:**

Use the batch encrypt command from the **Encryption Scheme** section above. All `.md` files in `KB_WORK_DIR` are encrypted to `.md.enc` in `KNOWLEDGE_DIR`. Stale `.md.enc` files with no corresponding source are deleted.

If encryption is not enabled, files were written directly to `KNOWLEDGE_DIR` in steps 13b–13e — skip this step.

**Step 2 — Push to the private KB repository (with remote existence check):**

Execute the git push sequence from the **Git Sync Rules** section above. The push step verifies remote reachability and auto-creates `origin/main` on first push using `--set-upstream`. If the remote is unreachable, it logs a warning and skips without failing the session.

**Step 3 — If encryption is enabled: delete the session temp directory:**
```bash
rm -rf "$KB_WORK_DIR"
echo "KB: session temp dir ${KB_WORK_DIR} deleted."
```

On success display (encryption enabled):
```

If push fails: replace the `Git` line with `Git: KB_PUSH_WARN — committed locally. Run: cd {KNOWLEDGE_DIR} && git push origin main`. If encryption was enabled, still delete `KB_WORK_DIR`.

#### 13g. Update Core Mental Map

Collect all `[CMM+]` markers emitted during the session (Steps 5, 7, 8, 9) and apply them to the `core-mental-map/` files. Morgan reviews the list and confirms which are genuinely new or corrective (not already reflected in the CMM entries read during Step 0b).

**For each `[CMM+]` marker:**

| Action tag | What to do |
|------------|-----------|
| `NEW` | Assign the next sequential ID for the file (e.g. `CMM-ARCH-004`). Append the compressed entry. Update `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` row (increment entry count, update summary, set Updated date). |
| `CONFIRM` | Increment `confirmed:` counter on the matching entry. Update `Updated:` date in the INDEX.md row. |
| `CORRECT` | Update `KEY:` and/or `ref:` fields with the fresh values from the live code read. Append `[CORRECTED {today}]` tag on its own line. Increment `contributors:`. Update INDEX.md row. |
| `DELETE` | Append `[DELETED {today}]` tag. Retain the entry body — historical knowledge of why something existed is still valuable. Update INDEX.md summary to note the deletion. |

**Stale ref auto-heal for Core Mental Map:** Apply the same auto-heal logic as Step 13c for any `ref:` lines in `core-mental-map/*.md` files where the file no longer exists at that path. Use the STALE_REF list collected in Step 0a.

**Cross-check bonus:** If during Steps 5–9 an agent explicitly verified a CMM entry against live code and found it still accurate, emit `[CMM+ ... CONFIRM]` and increment `confirmed:`. This cross-verification is the map's quality signal — a high `confirmed:` count means the fact has been independently verified by multiple sessions.

**After writing all CMM updates:**

```bash
# Update core-mental-map/INDEX.md — recount entries per file
for f in "$KB_WORK_DIR/core-mental-map/"*.md; do
  [ "$(basename $f)" = "INDEX.md" ] && continue
  count=$(grep -c "^## CMM-" "$f" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  fname=$(basename "$f")
  # Update the count and date in INDEX.md row for this file
  echo "CMM_REINDEX: $fname — $count entries"
done
# Update the Total entries count and Updated date in core-mental-map/INDEX.md header
```

Display:
```
🧠 Core Mental Map Updated
   Location     : {KNOWLEDGE_DIR}/core-mental-map/
   New entries  : {N} (CMM-{type}-NNN)
   Confirmed    : {N} entries verified against live code
   Corrected    : {N} entries updated with fresh info
   Deleted      : {N} entries marked obsolete
   Total entries: {N} across {M} files
```

Then close with the ready-to-code message from Step 12.

#### 13h. Save Lessons Learned

Collect all `[LL+]` markers emitted during the session (Steps 5, 7, 8, 9). Identify the current developer:

```bash
DEVELOPER="${PRX_DEVELOPER_NAME:-$(git config user.name | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')}"
LL_FILE="$KB_WORK_DIR/lessons-learned/${DEVELOPER}.md"
```

If the file does not exist, create it:
```markdown
# Lessons Learned — {DEVELOPER}
```

For each `[LL+]` marker, append a new entry using the next sequential ID:
```markdown
## LL-{NNN} — {title}
date: {today} | sprint: — | ticket: {TICKET_KEY}
PITFALL: {pitfall from marker}
KEY: {key lesson from marker}
ref: {ref from marker, or "—"}
```

If there are no `[LL+]` markers, skip this step — do not create an empty file.

Display:
```
📝 Lessons Learned
   Developer    : {DEVELOPER}
   File         : lessons-learned/{DEVELOPER}.md
   New entries  : {N} (LL-NNN … LL-NNN)
```

### Step 14 — Bryan's Retrospective

**Skip condition:** If `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED` is not set or is not `Y`/`YES`/`true` (case-insensitive), skip this step entirely. Display: `⏭️  Step 14 skipped — set PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y in .env to activate Bryan's retrospective.`

Bryan runs after every Dev Mode session, immediately after Step 13h. Bryan is a **silent observer** — he does not interrupt Steps 0–13. He now convenes a structured retrospective with the team.

#### Bryan's Mandate

| Responsibility | What Bryan does |
|---|---|
| **Token audit** | Compares Step 11 stats against budget targets; builds a step-level breakdown; flags hotspots |
| **Process audit** | Identifies friction, unclear instructions, repeated work, or steps that produced low-value output |
| **DoD guardian** | Checks that no required step was silently skipped or abbreviated without justification |
| **Skill sharpening** | Proposes one targeted SKILL.md edit per session — tighter wording, removed redundancy, collapsed steps — to make the skill sharper and cheaper over time |
| **Backlog management** | Maintains a prioritised improvement backlog in `process-efficiency.md`; recurrent issues get promoted to HIGH and jump the queue |
| **Impact tracking** | After each approved change, measures whether the next session actually cost less; records the delta |
| **Compaction pass** | Every `PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` sessions (default: 10), runs a deep SKILL.md review — eliminates dead weight, compresses verbose prose, merges redundant instructions, removes gates that are never triggered; requires full five-member approval |
| **Velocity dashboard** | Tracks rolling 5-session avg cost, monthly cumulative spend vs `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET`, token trend, and change acceptance rate; alerts when monthly spend exceeds 80% or 100% |
| **Blocker log** | Records recurring impediments (MCP failures, step skips, unclear outputs); a blocker seen 3+ times is auto-promoted to HIGH backlog priority |
| **Sprint health report** | Every `PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` sessions, generates a summary: tickets worked, avg cost, changes shipped, velocity trend, skill health score (0–100) |
| **Push gate** | Controlled by `PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS` (default: 3); when the threshold is reached, commits and pushes all queued changes to the plugin repo's main branch |

#### 14a. Pre-session Check — Backlog & Blockers

Before running the audit, Bryan:

**A. Gets actual monthly spend from ccusage:**

```bash
npx --yes ccusage@latest monthly --json 2>/dev/null
```

Parse the current calendar month's `totalCost` (or `cost`) field from the JSON. If ccusage is unavailable or returns no data for this month, fall back to summing the `cost: $N` values from all `[S-NNN]` rows in `shared/process-efficiency.md` for the current month.

**B. Then reads `shared/process-efficiency.md` for:**

1. **Monthly budget** — use the actual ccusage monthly spend (or the manual sum as fallback). If spend > 80% of `PRX_MONTHLY_BUDGET`, flag ⚠️ and note the remaining headroom. If spend ≥ 100%, flag ❌ and state that clearly in the token audit.
2. **Backlog** — note any HIGH-priority items. If the current session produced evidence for a HIGH item, it gets priority over new observations.
3. **Blockers** — increment the count for any blocker that recurred this session. Auto-promote to HIGH backlog if count reaches 3.
4. **Impact check** — if last session had an approved change, compare this session's cost against the pre-change baseline. Record the delta in the backlog row.
5. **Compaction trigger** — if `Sessions tracked % PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL == 0`, flag this as a compaction session.

#### 14b. Token & Process Audit

```

```

#### 14c. Proposed SKILL.md Change

Bryan selects **one** change — either the top HIGH backlog item (if evidence supports it this session) or the sharpest new observation. The change must be concrete: a specific before/after edit, not a vague suggestion.

**Sharpening heuristics Bryan applies:**
- Instructions that can say the same thing in half the words
- Steps that always output "N/A" or "none found" → add a fast-path skip condition
- Duplicate guidance spread across multiple steps → consolidate to one canonical location
- Passive voice or hedging that makes intent ambiguous → rewrite as direct imperatives
- Gates that have never been triggered across the last N sessions → consider removing

```

#### 14d. Compaction Pass *(compaction sessions only)*

On compaction sessions, Bryan replaces the single-change rule with a **full SKILL.md review**. Bryan reads the entire file and produces a compaction diff:

- Remove instructions that duplicate content already stated elsewhere
- Compress step preambles to ≤ 2 sentences — if it takes more to explain what a step does, the step is poorly scoped
- Collapse any two consecutive steps that share the same file reads or MCP calls
- Remove or gate any block that has produced zero output across the last `PRX_SKILL_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` sessions (as evidenced by the process-efficiency.md session log)
- Rewrite any instruction where the output format is inconsistently followed

Compaction requires **all five team members** to approve (Morgan + Riley + Alex + Sam + Jordan). Version bump is MINOR (x.Y.0).

Before applying any edits, Bryan presents the same **🔒 DEVELOPER CONFIRMATION** gate as in 14c — listing the full compaction diff summary, total estimated token reduction, and all five approvals — then asks `→ Proceed with compaction? [Y/n]:`. Skip the prompt if AUTO_MODE=Y. If the developer declines, append `[COMPACTION DEFERRED by developer: {today}]` to `process-efficiency.md` and skip the commit.

If confirmed (or AUTO_MODE=Y), Bryan commits the compaction as a single atomic commit: `"vX.Y.0 — Bryan: compaction pass #{N} (~{X}% token reduction)"`.

#### 14e. process-efficiency.md Update

`process-efficiency.md` uses an **append-only journal** — never edit existing lines, only append new ones. The header and Velocity Dashboard are auto-generated from the journal on every pull (see rebuild algorithm in the KB Sync section). This guarantees lossless `merge=union` in distributed mode regardless of how many developers push concurrently.

After every Step 14, **append** to `shared/process-efficiency.md`:

**1. New session record** (always):
```markdown
## [S-NNN] Session Record
date: {today} | developer: {DEVELOPER} | ticket: {TICKET_KEY} | type: {Bug/Enh} | cost: ${cost} | budget: ${budget} | status: ✅/⚠️
hotspot: {Step name} ({N}%) | change: {BL-NNN or "—"} | impact: {saving vs prev session or "baseline"}
```

**2. Backlog and blocker updates** — use the `[BL-NNN] Backlog Item` and `[BK-NNN] Blocker` journal entry formats defined in the **Knowledge Base** section. Key rules: new → append new block; recurrence → append `[SEEN+1]`/`[COUNT+1]`; promotion → append `[PROMOTED HIGH]`; applied → append `[APPLIED]`; resolved → append `[RESOLVED]`. Never edit existing lines.

The auto-generated header and Velocity Dashboard are rebuilt from the journal during the next pull (Step 0a) — not written here.

#### 14f. Skill Audit Trail

Run this step only when a change was approved **and** pushed this session (i.e., `N >= PRX_SKILL_UPGRADE_MIN_SESSIONS`).

**1. Append a row to the `## Skill Change Log` table in SKILL.md:**
```markdown
| SC-{NNN} | v{new} | {today} | {COMMIT_HASH} | {Compress/Remove/Clarify/Merge/Fast-path/Compaction} | {one-line summary} | ACTIVE |
```
This row lives in SKILL.md itself — anyone reading the file can see the full change history at a glance.

**2. Append a full entry to `shared/skill-changelog.md` in the KB:**
```markdown
## [SC-{NNN}] v{new} — {one-line summary}
date: {today} | commit: {COMMIT_HASH} | backlog-ref: {BL-NNN or "new"} | type: {type}
PROBLEM: {what was inefficient or unclear}
BEFORE: "{exact old wording — quote verbatim}"
AFTER: "{exact new wording — quote verbatim}"
voters: Morgan ✅ | Riley ✅ | {Engineer} ✅
```

**3. Revert procedure** — if a Bryan change later causes problems, any developer can:
```bash
# 1. Find the commit hash — either from SKILL.md's Skill Change Log table
#    or from shared/skill-changelog.md SC-{NNN} entry
git log --oneline | grep "Bryan SC-"

# 2. Revert the specific commit (safe — creates a new revert commit, no history rewrite)
git revert <COMMIT_HASH>
git push origin main

# 3. Append revert tag to the SC-{NNN} entry in shared/skill-changelog.md:
# [REVERTED: {today} — revert-commit: {revert-hash} — reason: {one-line}]

# 4. Update the row in SKILL.md's Skill Change Log: change Status to REVERTED
#    (this is the only in-place edit Bryan ever makes to the log — acceptable since
#    it is a revert operation, not a new append, and git history preserves the full story)
```

If a compaction pass needs to be reverted, the same procedure applies — the compaction commit hash is recorded in the SC-NNN entry.

#### Consensus Rules

- Regular change: unanimous approval from Morgan + Riley + highest-scoring engineer (or any one engineer for enhancements)
- Compaction pass: unanimous approval from all five team members
- Rejected change: re-queued in backlog with "seen N times" counter incremented; if seen 3+ times, promoted to HIGH
- No change proposed: skip consensus; still update process-efficiency.md

## PR Review Mode

Execute these steps when the invocation triggers **PR Review Mode** (see Mode Selection above). Do not run the Dev Mode steps. Present output for each step as it completes.

---

### Step R0 — Knowledge Base: Initialise & Query

Identical to Step 0 in Dev Mode. Run Phase A (initialise) before Step R1, and Phase B (query by components/labels) after Step R1.

The Prior Knowledge block carries into:
- Step R2 (does KB confirm or extend the problem statement and acceptance criteria?)
- Step R5 (reviewers must state whether KB patterns or risks are relevant to the diff — Morgan must reference KB history in the verdict)
- Step R6 (consolidated report must note whether any finding recurs from a KB entry)

---

### Step R1 — Read the Jira Ticket

Identical to Step 1 in Dev Mode. Use `mcp__jira__get_issue` with the ticket key. Request fields: `summary`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `status`, `assignee`, `reporter`, `labels`, `components`, `fixVersions`, `versions`, `description`, `comment`, `attachment`.

Display the same field summary as Step 1.

**If the MCP call fails**, stop and state the error. Do not proceed.

---

### Step R2 — Understand the Problem & Associated Tickets

Execute the full Step 2 from Dev Mode without omission: problem statement, **linked & associated ticket analysis**, attachment analysis, and optional issue diagram.

**Linked tickets are mandatory for review context.** Apply the full **Linked & Associated Tickets** procedure from Step 2 (two-phase lazy fetch; High-relevance tickets get full fetch + PR analysis; Low-relevance get summary only). One review-specific difference: step 3 per linked ticket reads `[KEY] (type, status) — one-sentence relevance to the **code review**` rather than to the ticket generally.

Carry all findings forward into Step R5 — reviewers need the full acceptance context to judge correctness.

---

### Step R3 — Read Comments for Additional Context

Identical to Step 3 in Dev Mode. Fetch all comments and extract any prior investigation, decisions, constraints, or known issues.

Produce a **Prior Investigation Summary** block if applicable. Carry all findings into Step R5 so reviewers have full context.

---

### Step R4 — Identify & Fetch Code Changes

#### R4a. Locate the Feature Branch

Search for the branch associated with this ticket:

```bash
git branch --list "Feature/{TICKET_KEY}*"
git branch -r | grep "Feature/{TICKET_KEY}"
```

If a single matching branch is found, use it. If multiple branches match, list them and ask the developer which one to review. If no branch is found:

```bash
git branch --list "*{TICKET_KEY}*"
git branch -r | grep "{TICKET_KEY}"
```

If still not found, ask the developer to provide the branch name before continuing.

#### R4b. Determine the Base Branch

Use the same base branch logic as Step 4a in Dev Mode (Fix Version → Affected Version → `development`).

#### R4c. Get the Diff

First, extract the list of files touched by this PR and bind it as `CHANGED_FILES` — all subsequent review operations are scoped to this list only:

```bash
git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...{FEATURE_BRANCH} --name-only
```

Store the output as `CHANGED_FILES` (newline-separated paths). This is the authoritative set of files reviewers may read or grep. Any file not in `CHANGED_FILES` must not be read unless it is a direct caller of a changed method identified via grep.

Then fetch the full diff and stats:

```bash
git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...{FEATURE_BRANCH} --stat
git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...{FEATURE_BRANCH}
```

Also get the commit log for the branch:

```bash
git log --oneline {BASE_BRANCH}..{FEATURE_BRANCH}
```

#### R4d. Present the Change Summary

Display:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature branch | `{feature branch name}` |
| Base branch | `{base branch name}` |
| Commits | `{N commits}` |
| Files changed | `{N files}` |

Then list every changed file with its change type (modified / added / deleted) and lines changed (+X -Y):

| File | Change type | +/- lines |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `fcfrontend/.../CaseManager.java` | Modified | +42 −18 |

If the diff is empty (no changes found), state: "No code changes found on this branch relative to `{BASE_BRANCH}`. Confirm the branch name and base branch are correct." and stop.

**Large diff handling** — if the total lines changed across all files exceeds **500 lines**, do not read the full diff in one block. Instead:

1. **Pre-read pass**: read the `--stat` output and the commit log only (already done above).
2. **Reviewer file assignment**: assign each changed file to the reviewer whose mandate best covers it:
   - Alex → files with significant git history changes or commit-message anomalies
   - Sam → files containing the core logic change (the primary fix path)
   - Jordan → files with structural changes, new abstractions, or interface modifications
   - Riley → test files; any file touched by more than 3 callers (regression surface)
3. Each reviewer reads **only their assigned files** via targeted reads — not the full diff.
4. State the assignment before review begins:

```
Large diff detected: {N} total lines changed across {M} files.
File assignments:
  Alex  → {file list}
  Sam   → {file list}
  Jordan → {file list}
  Riley → {file list}
```

---

### Step R5 — Engineering Panel Code Review

The same team from Dev Mode convenes to review the code changes, with adjusted mandates:

| Role | Name | Review Focus |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Lead Reviewer** | **Morgan** | Chairs. Sets review schedule. Cross-examines. Scores engineers. Gives binding verdict: Approve / Request Changes / Reject. |
| Senior Reviewer | Alex | Code quality, readability, commit hygiene, architecture alignment, adherence to project conventions |
| Senior Reviewer | Sam | Logic correctness, data flow accuracy, correct fix for the stated root cause / enhancement |
| Senior Reviewer | Jordan | Defensive patterns (full 20-pattern checklist), structural anti-patterns, class hierarchy ownership |
| **Lead QA Reviewer** | **Riley** | Test coverage assessment, testability of the changes, regression surface, missing edge cases, acceptance criteria coverage |

Engineers (Alex, Sam, Jordan) are competing for **Best Review** distinction. Riley and Morgan are not competing.

#### R5a. Morgan Opens — Historical JIRA Search + Lead Briefing

Before briefing the review team, Morgan runs a mandatory JIRA historical search identical to the one performed in Dev Mode Step 7b-i. This surfaces any past resolutions, known regression notes, or prior investigations on the same component/label that inform the review.

**R5a-i. Morgan's JIRA Historical Search**

Run the same JQL queries as Step 7b-i (component match + label match, status Done/Resolved/Closed). For each result:
1. Retrieve full ticket details and scan comments for root cause, fix location, regression warnings.
2. Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` or `[KB+ ARCH]` markers for any newly discovered business knowledge.
3. Present the Historical JIRA Precedents block (same format as Step 7b-i) before the review briefing.

If no matching tickets found: state "No historical tickets found — proceeding fresh."
If JIRA search fails: log `JIRA_SEARCH_WARN:` and continue.

**R5a-ii. Morgan Lead Review Briefing**

#### R5b. Parallel Review — All Four Reviewers (4-minute block)

Each reviewer has a **4-minute window** capped at **8 targeted operations** (reads of specific diff hunks, greps for callers/usages, reads of surrounding context for a changed method). Riley is capped at **6 operations**. The Grep-First, Read-Second rule applies.

**Scope constraint:** All read and grep operations are restricted to files in `CHANGED_FILES` (derived in R4c). Reviewers must not open or search files outside this set unless a grep reveals a direct caller of a changed method in another file — in which case that file may be read once, counts as one operation, and must be noted as "outside CHANGED_FILES".

---

**Alex — Code Quality & Conventions**
*"Clean code is code your team can still understand in six months."*

Alex reviews in priority order (stop early on High confidence findings):
1. Naming conventions — do new classes, methods, and fields follow the project's existing naming style?
2. Code structure — is the change well-organised? Is logic in the right layer?
3. Duplication — does the change introduce duplicated logic that should be extracted?
4. Commit hygiene — do commit messages follow the project format? Are there unnecessary or partial commits?
5. Dead code — are there commented-out lines, unused variables, or TODO markers left in the diff?
6. Readability — are complex sections adequately clear given the existing comment style in the codebase?
7. Consistency — does the code style (spacing, bracket style, logging pattern) match the surrounding file?
8. Architecture alignment — does the change fit the established layering and responsibility model?

**Alex KB annotations (Review):** Emit `[KB+ ARCH]` if the diff reveals a layer interaction or ownership decision (e.g. "config wiring belongs in concrete subclass per this pattern"). Emit `[KB+ RISK]` if a shared utility or widely-used method was modified.

---

**Sam — Logic Correctness & Root Cause Alignment**
*"The fix must actually fix the thing. Follow the data to confirm it does."*

Sam reviews in priority order:
1. Re-read the Enhancement Statement or Root Cause Statement from Step R2/R3 — what was the fix supposed to do?
2. Trace the changed code path — does the new logic produce the correct outcome for the primary case?
3. Check boundary conditions in the diff — does the fix handle nulls, empty collections, and edge values?
4. Check whether the fix is complete — are there other call sites or paths where the same issue could still occur?
5. Check for unintended side effects — does any changed method affect behaviour for callers not related to the reported issue?
6. Check the data flow end-to-end through the diff — is the correct value produced at each transition?
7. Verify acceptance criteria coverage — for each criterion listed in Step R2, confirm a code path exists that satisfies it
8. Confirm the fix does not silently degrade any related functionality

**Sam KB annotations (Review):** Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` for any domain rule confirmed or violated by the diff (e.g. "fix correctly sets pendingAlertResolve before save — BIZ-001 confirmed"). Emit `[KB+ ARCH]` for any data flow interaction made visible by reading the diff.

---

**Jordan — Defensive Patterns & Structural Anti-Patterns**
*"I've catalogued every way Java developers shoot themselves in the foot."*

Jordan applies the full 20-pattern checklist (same table as Step 7) to every changed file in the diff. For each pattern, Jordan checks only the changed code (additions and modifications) — not unchanged surrounding code, unless it is called by the new code.

Report findings in this format:
```
Pattern N — {Pattern Name}: {Finding}
  File: {file:line}
  Code: {one-line quote from diff}
  Severity: Critical / Major / Minor
  Recommendation: {what to change}
```

If a pattern has no finding in the diff, state: `Pattern N — {Pattern Name}: No issue found in diff.`

**Jordan KB annotations (Review):** Emit `[KB+ PAT] Pattern #{N}: {description} — {file:line} [NEW]` for first occurrences or `[BUMP]` for recurrences, exactly as in Dev Mode. Emit `[KB+ ARCH]` for any structural insight from the diff.

---

**Riley — Test Coverage & Acceptance Criteria**
*"A fix that can't be verified is a fix that can't be trusted."*

Riley reviews in priority order (stop when impact picture is clear):
1. Are there any new or modified tests in the diff? If yes, do they cover the primary fix path?
2. Do the tests cover at least one negative case (null input, empty input, error path)?
3. For each acceptance criterion from Step R2 — is there a test that would catch a regression of that criterion?
4. What is the regression surface of the change? List flows that pass through the changed code that are not covered by the tests in the diff.
5. Identify any edge cases that are not tested: concurrent access, DB dialect differences, multi-client data isolation, session boundaries.
6. Assess testability: can the fix be verified from the UI/API, or does it require DB-level verification? Flag anything that is not observable without internal access.

**Riley KB annotations (Review):** Emit `[KB+ RISK]` for every fragile area or untested regression surface identified. Emit `[KB+ BIZ]` if an acceptance criterion implies a domain rule not yet in the KB.

Riley submits a **Test Coverage Assessment** in this format:
```
┌─ Riley — Test Coverage Assessment ─────────────────────────────┐
│ Tests in diff      : {Yes — N tests / No — none added}          │
│ Primary path       : {Covered / Not covered}                    │

#### R5g. Morgan's Review Verdict — T+6 minutes

Morgan weighs all findings and delivers a binding verdict using this scoring rubric:

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Specific `file:line` cited with code evidence | +3 |
| Finding is directly actionable (clear recommendation) | +2 |
| Finding survived cross-examination without revision | +2 |
| Finding is corroborated by another reviewer independently | +2 |
| Found efficiently (≤ 5 ops used) | +1 |
| Debate challenge successfully deflected with evidence | +1 |
| Finding is testability-relevant and Riley corroborates it | +1 |

Maximum score: 12 pts per reviewer. Morgan scores Alex, Sam, and Jordan. Riley is not scored.

```
─── Morgan's Review Verdict ───────────────────────────────────────

Scores:
  Alex   : {N} / 12 pts — [one-line assessment]
  Sam    : {N} / 12 pts — [one-line assessment]
  Jordan : {N} / 12 pts — [one-line assessment]

Coverage view (Riley):
  [Morgan addresses Riley's coverage assessment — one to two sentences.
   Must state whether any Insufficient coverage concerns block approval.]

My assessment:
  [Morgan weighs in personally — 2–4 sentences. Morgan may endorse
   the highest-scoring reviewer's findings, refine them, or add
   independent findings from up to 4 additional targeted reads.]

Overall verdict:
  ✅ APPROVED — changes are correct, clean, and safe to merge.

  — or —

  ⚠️  APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS — merge after addressing:
     [{list of specific conditions — file:line and what to change}]

  — or —

  🔄 REQUEST CHANGES — [{summary of blocking issues}].
     Required before re-review:
     [{bulleted list of required changes with file:line references}]

  — or —

  ❌ REJECT — [{reason — fundamental approach is wrong or introduces
     unacceptable risk}]. Recommended path:

#### R8c. Convert to PDF

Same three-method sequence as Step 12c in Dev Mode (pandoc → Chrome headless → HTML fallback). Use filename `{TICKET_KEY}-review` instead of `{TICKET_KEY}-analysis`:

```bash
pandoc /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-review.md \
  -o "{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf" \
  --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf \
  -V geometry:margin=2cm \
  -V fontsize=11pt
```

#### R8d. Archive and Confirm

```
📄 Review Report Generated
   Folder : {REPORT_DIR}/
   File   : {REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf
   Format : PDF  ← (or "HTML (PDF libraries unavailable)" if fallback used)
   Verdict: {✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / 🔄 REQUEST CHANGES / ❌ REJECT}
   Issues : Critical: {N}  Major: {N}  Minor: {N}
```

#### R8e. Temp File Cleanup

```bash
rm -f /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-review.md /tmp/{TICKET_KEY}-review.html
```

Then end with:

> **Review complete.** See `{REPORT_DIR}/{TICKET_KEY}-review.pdf` for the full findings. {If REQUEST CHANGES or REJECT: "Share the report with the developer and request re-review after issues are addressed."}

---

### Step R9 — Knowledge Base: Record Review Learnings

After Step R8 confirms the PDF has been saved, update the knowledge base with what the review panel discovered. This ensures review findings are available to future Dev and Review sessions on related tickets.

#### R9a. Identify What Is Worth Recording

Scan the **full review session output** (all steps) and extract knowledge from two sources:

**Source 1 — `[KB+]` inline annotations** (primary source):

Scan all reviewer output (Steps R4, R5) for `[KB+]` markers emitted during the review. Same markers and target files as Step 13a. Morgan confirms which are genuinely new before writing. Note: `[KB+ BIZ]` in Review Mode may capture both confirmations and violations of business rules.

**Source 2 — Structured review extracts** (fallback — anything not already annotated):

| Category | Source | What to extract |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Confirmed / refuted root causes** | Steps R2, R3 | Does the code fix actually match the stated root cause? Record the confirmation. |
| **Business rules confirmed** | Steps R2, R5 (Sam) | Any business rule validated by seeing it correctly implemented in the diff |
| **Business rules violated** | Step R5 (Sam, Morgan) | Any business rule the diff violated — record with `⚠️ VIOLATION` tag |
| **Architecture insights** | Step R5 (Morgan, Sam) | Class hierarchy, ownership, layer responsibilities visible in the diff |
| **Patterns in the review** | Step R5 (Jordan) | Which of Jordan's 20 patterns appeared — check KB for NEW vs BUMP |
| **Regression risks confirmed** | Step R5 (Riley, Morgan) | Fragile areas Riley identified that future changes must protect |
| **QA gaps discovered** | Step R5 (Riley) | Missing test coverage — record so future tickets know to test these paths |
| **Historical JIRA precedents** | Step R5a Morgan JIRA search | Any business rule or architecture insight from past closed tickets |

Morgan de-duplicates across both sources before writing.

If the verdict is **APPROVED** with no noteworthy findings, state: "No new knowledge beyond ticket confirmation — recording ticket result only." and write only the ticket entry (R9b).

#### R9b. Write the Ticket Entry

Create or overwrite `{KNOWLEDGE_DIR}/tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md`. For review sessions, use `type: bug-fix-reviewed` or `type: enhancement-reviewed` and populate the `verdict` field with the Morgan verdict.

Include a **Review Findings Summary** section in the file:
```markdown
## Review Findings Summary
Verdict: {✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / 🔄 REQUEST CHANGES / ❌ REJECT}
Critical issues: {N} | Major: {N} | Minor: {N}

{bulleted list of the most significant findings — Critical and Major only}
```

#### R9c. Update Shared Files

Apply the same rules as Step 13c in Dev Mode:
- **Confirm** existing business rules that the diff correctly implements (add `Confirmed by: {TICKET_KEY} review`)
- **Flag violations** of existing business rules as new entries in `shared/business-rules.md` with a `⚠️ VIOLATION` tag, citing the review finding
- Bump pattern frequency counters in `shared/patterns.md` for any Jordan patterns found in the diff
- Add or update regression risks identified by Riley in `shared/regression-risks.md`
- Append architecture insights discovered from reading the diff to `shared/architecture.md`

#### R9d. Update INDEX.md — Memory Palace section

Same process as Step 13d — for each new or updated entry, add triggers to the matched room(s) in the `## Memory Palace` section of INDEX.md, bump frequency counters for recurring patterns.

#### R9e. Update INDEX.md — Master Index section

Same as Step 13e — add/update the ticket row in `### Ticket Entries`, add new shared entries to `### Shared Knowledge Entries`, update header counts and date.

#### R9f. Publish KB

Follow the same publish procedure as Step 13f (encrypt if `PRX_KB_KEY` is set → git push → delete temp dir; same failure handling). Use the review-specific display formats below instead of the Dev Mode formats.

**If `KB_MODE=local`:**
```

#### R9g. Update Core Mental Map

Apply the same process as Step 13g in Dev Mode. Scan all `[CMM+]` markers emitted during Steps R4 and R5 (reviewers may discover architecture facts, gotchas, or stale CMM entries while reading the code diff). Apply NEW / CONFIRM / CORRECT / DELETE actions and update `core-mental-map/INDEX.md` counts.

PR Review sessions are especially well-suited to confirming (or correcting) existing CMM entries because reviewers read the actual code changes — they can verify whether a CMM fact is still accurate in the patched version.

#### R9h. Save Lessons Learned

Apply the same process as Step 13h in Dev Mode. Collect `[LL+]` markers emitted during Steps R4 and R5, and append them to `lessons-learned/{developer}.md`.

---

### Step R10 — Bryan's Retrospective

**Skip condition:** Same as Step 14 — if `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED` is not `Y`/`YES`/`true`, skip entirely.

Identical to Step 14 in Dev Mode with these differences:
- Token audit uses Step R7 session stats
- DoD check covers Steps R0–R9h (not Steps 0–13h)
- Consensus panel: Morgan + Riley + the reviewer from Step R5 whose findings were most substantive
- `process-efficiency.md` Session Log row records the review verdict (✅ / ⚠️ / 🔄 / ❌) in the `Status` column instead of budget status
- Compaction pass eligibility counts PR Review sessions in the same `Sessions tracked` counter as Dev Mode sessions

---

---

## Estimate Mode

Execute these steps when the invocation triggers **Estimate Mode** (see Mode Selection above). Do not run Dev Mode or PR Review Mode steps. Present output for each step as it completes.

Story points measure **effort** — not hours. Each point reflects three combined factors:
- **Complexity** — how technically difficult or unclear the work is
- **Risk** — uncertainty, third-party dependencies, regression exposure, unknowns
- **Repetition** — how familiar the team is with this type of work (high familiarity = fewer points)

Scale (modified Fibonacci): **1 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 8 · 13 · 20 · ?**

| Points | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial — very low complexity, minimal risk, team has done this many times |
| 2 | Simple — low complexity, low risk, familiar territory |
| 3 | Small — one area of moderate complexity or some risk or limited familiarity |
| 5 | Medium — notable complexity + some risk, or one meaningful unknown |
| 8 | Large — high complexity or significant risk or unfamiliar system area |
| 13 | Very large — multiple complex areas, several risks, needs careful planning |
| 20 | Epic — too broad; strong recommendation to split before committing |
| ? | Cannot estimate — spike required to resolve critical unknowns first |

Points are **relative**: a 4-point task is twice the effort of a 2-point task. They are never converted to hours.

Each engineer draws on their **acquired knowledge of the system** — the KB (`core-mental-map/`, `shared/patterns.md`, `shared/gotchas.md`, past ticket records, `lessons-learned/`) and their domain expertise — to score all three dimensions before committing to a vote. The KB is the team's shared memory; it must be actively consulted, not just acknowledged.

Bryan observes silently and runs Step E8 if `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED=Y`. The session ends only when the full team reaches a single agreed story point.

---

### Step E0 — KB Initialisation & System Knowledge Load

Same process as Step 0 in Dev Mode. Pull KB and surface prior knowledge on the ticket's components and labels.

**Additionally**, each engineer reads the following before E2 begins — this is the system knowledge that will drive their estimates:

- `core-mental-map/architecture.md` — component boundaries, ownership, coupling hotspots
- `core-mental-map/gotchas.md` — non-obvious footguns and edge-case traps in the affected area
- `core-mental-map/data-flows.md` — write paths, RPC contracts, side-effects
- `shared/patterns.md` — search for `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` entries on the affected components
- `tickets/` — scan for `## Estimation` sections on past tickets touching the same components
- `lessons-learned/` — any developer-recorded pitfalls relevant to this area
- `shared/process-efficiency.md` — check for past estimation accuracy notes

Present the Prior Knowledge block (same format as Step 0) and append an **Estimation-relevant KB findings** subsection:

```
── Estimation KB Findings ────────────────────────────────────────────
  Past estimates on similar work:
  • {TICKET_KEY}: {N}pts — {one-line reason} (accuracy: {over/under/accurate} vs actual)
  • {or "none found"}

  Known complexity patterns (from patterns.md / gotchas.md):
  • {pattern 1 relevant to this ticket}
  • {or "none found"}

  Relevant lessons learned:
  • {lesson entry or "none found"}
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

### Step E1 — Ingest Ticket

Same as Step 1 in Dev Mode. Fetch all standard Jira fields. Also surface:
- The current **Story Points** field value if already set — show it as context only; instruct the team not to anchor on it during voting
- Any **sub-tasks** already linked (they reduce scope of the parent)
- Explicit **acceptance criteria** — the team estimates the full AC, not just the description

---

### Step E2 — Scope & Dimension Analysis

Before any individual votes are cast, the full Engineering Panel jointly maps the ticket against the three story point dimensions, drawing explicitly on the KB findings from E0 and each engineer's system knowledge.

```
── Scope & Dimension Analysis ────────────────────────────────────────
  Ticket type : {Bug / Story / Enhancement / Spike}
  Delivers    : {one-line restatement of what must be done to close the ticket}

  Work areas:
  ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬──────────┐
  │ Area                 │ What changes                     │ Effort   │
  ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼──────────┤
  │ Backend              │ {what changes or "—"}            │ Low/Med/High │
  │ Frontend             │ {what changes or "—"}            │ Low/Med/High │
  │ Database             │ {schema/migration or "—"}        │ Low/Med/High │
  │ Infrastructure       │ {config/env/deploy or "—"}       │ Low/Med/High │
  │ Tests                │ {unit/integration/e2e scope}     │ Low/Med/High │
  └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴──────────┘

  Dimension drivers:
  ┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Dimension       │ Level        │ Evidence (from KB / system knowledge) │
  ├─────────────────┼──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Complexity      │ Low/Med/High │ {what makes it hard or simple — cite KB} │
  │ Risk            │ Low/Med/High │ {unknowns, dependencies, regression surface} │
  │ Repetition      │ Familiar/Partial/New │ {KB patterns found / past tickets / new territory} │
  └─────────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘

  Unknowns  : {things that, if unresolved, make any estimate unreliable}
  Dependencies: {external services, teams, or tickets that must land first}
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Spike gate:** If there are critical unknowns that make the Complexity or Risk dimension impossible to assess, recommend a spike and stop — do not proceed to E3 unless the developer overrides.

**Split gate:** If the ticket spans 4+ areas at Medium/High effort, recommend splitting into sub-tasks and offer to estimate each separately.

---

### Step E3 — Planning Poker: Round 1

Each engineer independently scores all three dimensions through their domain lens, then commits to a single Fibonacci vote **before** seeing others' numbers. All five votes are revealed simultaneously.

**Domain focus per engineer:**

| Engineer | Complexity lens | Risk lens | Repetition lens |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Morgan** | Architectural complexity; system design decisions required | System-wide regression risk; dependency chain risk | Has the team solved a structurally similar problem before? |
| **Alex** | Backend algorithm complexity; API surface changes; data model impact | Data migration risk; third-party API reliability | Are the affected services well-understood by the backend team? |
| **Sam** | Business logic complexity; cross-layer integration; AC ambiguity | Stakeholder/domain rule uncertainty; acceptance criteria gaps | Has this class of feature been built before in this codebase? |
| **Jordan** | Infrastructure/config complexity; cross-service protocol changes | Deployment risk; environment-specific behaviour; breaking changes | Is this deployment pattern routine or novel for the team? |
| **Riley** | Test complexity; observable edge-case surface area | Regression risk; unknown coverage gaps; flaky test likelihood | Does a test harness already exist for this area? |

**Vote card format (each engineer, stated after the simultaneous reveal):**

```
{Name} — {N} pts
  Complexity  : {Low/Med/High} — {specific reason, citing system knowledge or KB entry}
  Risk        : {Low/Med/High} — {specific uncertainty or dependency driving this}
  Repetition  : {Familiar/Partial/New} — {KB pattern or past ticket reference, or "no prior art found"}
  Key unknown : {the single thing that, if resolved, would most change their vote}
```

**Reveal format:**

```
── Planning Poker — Round 1 ──────────────────────────────────────────
  🃏  Morgan   │  Alex   │  Sam   │  Jordan  │  Riley
      {N}      │  {N}    │  {N}   │   {N}    │   {N}

  Range: {min}–{max}   Spread: {max − min} points
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Immediately print all five vote cards.

If all five votes are identical → skip E4, proceed to E5 with confidence **High**.

---

### Step E4 — Debate & Consensus

Run only when votes differ after any round. Maximum **3 debate rounds** before Morgan makes a binding final call.

Debates must be grounded in the three dimensions — not just "your number feels high." When an engineer challenges another's vote, they must name which dimension they disagree on and cite system knowledge or KB evidence.

#### Debate structure (each round)

1. **Highest voter speaks first** — which dimension(s) are others underweighting, and what system knowledge or KB evidence supports their assessment?
2. **Lowest voter responds** — which simplifying factors apply, and what KB entries or past patterns support a lower score?
3. **Remaining engineers react** — one paragraph each: which argument moved them (if any) and why? Are they revising their vote?
4. **Re-vote** — simultaneous reveal, same format as E3. Label it Round 2, Round 3, etc.

After each re-vote:
- All votes match → consensus reached; proceed to E5
  - Round 2 → confidence **Medium**
  - Round 3 → confidence **Low**
- Still differ → continue (up to Round 3)

#### Morgan's binding final call (after Round 3 without consensus)

```
── Morgan — Binding Final Call ───────────────────────────────────────
  After {N} rounds without consensus:
  Final estimate : {N} story points
  Deciding factor: {which dimension was the sticking point and how Morgan
                    resolved the disagreement — cite specific system
                    knowledge or KB evidence that tipped the balance}
  Dissenting view: {who voted differently, their dimension argument, and
                    why it was not adopted — recorded for transparency}
  Confidence     : Low — revisit if {specific condition or unknown} changes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

### Step E5 — Final Estimate

```
══ ESTIMATE RESULT ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Story Points : {N}
  Confidence   : High / Medium / Low
  Consensus    : Unanimous (Round {N}) / Morgan final call (after Round {N})
  Ticket       : {TICKET_KEY} — {summary}

  Dimension summary:
  • Complexity  : {Low/Med/High} — {key driver}
  • Risk        : {Low/Med/High} — {key driver}
  • Repetition  : {Familiar/Partial/New} — {key driver}

  Key assumptions:
  • {assumption 1}
  • {assumption 2}

  What would change this estimate:
  • {if X is resolved/discovered} → could shift to {N} pts
  • {if scope expands to Y} → recommend splitting

  Recommended action:
  • ✅  Proceed as estimated
  • ⚠️   Spike first — resolve: {specific unknown}
  • 🔀  Split recommended — {suggested sub-task breakdown}

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

### Step E6 — Jira Update

If `AUTO_MODE=Y`, automatically update the Story Points field in Jira to the agreed estimate.

Otherwise, ask:
```
→ Update Story Points in Jira to {N}? [Y/n]:
```

If confirmed (or AUTO_MODE=Y), use the `editJiraIssue` MCP tool to set the story points field, then confirm:
```
✅ Jira updated — {TICKET_KEY} story points set to {N}
```

If declined or MCP unavailable, state the agreed estimate so the developer can update manually.

---

### Step E7 — KB Update

Record the estimation session so future sessions can reference past sizing decisions for similar work.

**1. Ticket file** (`tickets/{TICKET_KEY}.md`) — append an `## Estimation` section:
```markdown
## Estimation
date: {today} | estimate: {N}pts | confidence: {High/Med/Low} | rounds: {N} | consensus: {Unanimous/Morgan call}
complexity: {Low/Med/High} | risk: {Low/Med/High} | repetition: {Familiar/Partial/New}
assumptions: {key assumptions, comma-separated}
what-would-change: {conditions that would shift the estimate}
```

**2. Shared patterns** (`shared/patterns.md`) — if any dimension driver will recur on future similar tickets, append an `[ESTIMATE-PATTERN]` annotation:
```markdown
[ESTIMATE-PATTERN] {component/area}: {insight — e.g. "DB migrations in the X service always push complexity to High due to dual-write requirement"} — first seen: {TICKET_KEY} ({N}pts)
```

**3. INDEX.md** — add triggers to the relevant Memory Palace rooms for the components touched during estimation.

---

### Step E8 — Bryan's Retrospective (Estimate Mode)

**Skip condition:** Same as Step 14 — if `PRX_INCLUDE_SM_IN_SESSIONS_ENABLED` is not `Y`/`YES`/`true`, skip entirely.

Identical to Step 14 in Dev Mode with these differences:
- Token audit: run `npx --yes ccusage@latest daily --json` and compute session delta from baseline (same as Step 11)
- DoD check covers Steps E0–E7
- Process audit focuses on estimation quality: Did engineers cite KB evidence or rely on gut feel? Were the dimension drivers grounded in system knowledge? Were debate rounds substantive or circular? Did the existing Jira value anchor any votes?
- Session Log row format:
  ```
  date: {today} | developer: {DEVELOPER} | ticket: {TICKET_KEY} | type: Estimate | cost: ${cost} | estimate: {N}pts ({confidence}, {N} rounds) | status: ✅
  ```
- No branch creation or code changes — Bryan's SKILL.md improvement proposals focus on the estimation workflow itself

## Output Format

Present output in clearly labelled sections. Use markdown headings. Keep each section concise but complete.

**Dev Mode:** Step 0 (KB query) → Steps 1–12 → Step 13 (KB update) → Step 14 (Bryan retrospective). Step 12 produces the PDF confirmation; Step 13 produces the KB update confirmation; Step 14 closes the session.

**PR Review Mode:** Step R0 (KB query) → Steps R1–R8 → Step R9 (KB update) → Step R10 (Bryan retrospective). Step R8 produces the PDF confirmation; Step R9 produces the KB update confirmation; Step R10 closes the session.

**Estimate Mode:** Step E0 (KB query) → Steps E1–E7 (scope → planning poker → debate → consensus → Jira update → KB update) → Step E8 (Bryan retrospective). Step E5 produces the final estimate; Step E7 produces the KB update confirmation; Step E8 closes the session.

---

## Project Context

- **Repository:** `{REPO_DIR}/` (configured via `REPO_DIR` in `SKILL.md` Configuration section)
- **Main branch:** `development` (or as configured in your repo)
- **Branch format:** `Feature/{TICKET_KEY}_{Title}`
- **Jira instance:** `{JIRA_URL}` (from env var)
- **Tech stack:** Adapt the file path patterns in steps 5–8 to match your project's directory structure.
